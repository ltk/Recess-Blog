You know, I would have taken your article seriously if you hadn''t said Katy Perry deserved album of the year. Lol, are you high? It was a tie between Lady Antebellum and Arcade Fire, the only two artists (real artists) that deserved to nominated for album of the year. Do yourself a favor and listen to the 5 albums back to back and think again. Katy Perry is a big joke, sure she makes lots of money and has more fans than a band like Arcade Fire. She cannot play an instrument and she''s an instrument of a large record company, know what I''m sayin''? ;), All of the members in Arcade Fire are multi-instrumentalists and their songs are emotional and deep. Comparing Katy Perry to them is like comparing Justin Bieber to the Beatles. Arcade Fire is on a whole different artistic level that dwarfs a petty artist like miss Perry.

''/local-config.php'' );\n  define( ''WP_LOCAL_DEV'', true ); // We''ll talk about this later\n} else {\n  define( ''DB_NAME'',     ''production_db''       );\n  define( ''DB_USER'',     ''production_user''     );\n  define( ''DB_PASSWORD'', ''production_password'' );\n  define( ''DB_HOST'',     ''production_db_host''  );\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Ignore the <code>WP_LOCAL_DEV</code> define&#8230; I&#8217;ll explain that later.</p>\n<p>Now open up your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain;">\n/dir-that-contains-wp-config/local-config.php\n</pre>\n<p>There. Now you can just create a <code>local-config.php</code> file and put your <code>DB_*</code> defines in there. And thanks to the <code>.gitignore</code> addition, you won&#8217;t have to worry about accidentally committing your local config.</p>\n<p>But what if you want to override other defines locally? Well, just modify them in <code>wp-config.php</code> like so:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php;">\nif ( !defined( ''SCRIPT_DEBUG'' ) )\n  define( ''SCRIPT_DEBUG'', false );\n</pre>\n<p>And make sure they&#8217;re after the <code>local-config.php</code> block. Now you can override these defines as well.</p>\n<h3>Plugins that are production-only</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://vaultpress.com/">VaultPress</a> from Automattic. But this is not something you want to run on your localhost. Other backup plugins probably fall into this category of &#8220;production-only.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bad way to do this is to remember to disable this plugin after you import a DB snapshot to your localhost. Boo. Remember <code>WP_LOCAL_DEV</code> that we set earlier? Let&#8217;s use it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a quick &#8220;must-use&#8221; plugin to handle conditional plugin disabling. <a href="https://gist.github.com/1044546">Get it here</a>, and put it in the <code>mu-plugins</code> directory (create it in your WP content directory if you don&#8217;t already have one).</p>\n<p>The part you modify is at the bottom:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php;">\nnew CWS_Disable_Plugins_When_Local_Dev( array( ''vaultpress.php'' ) );\n</pre>\n<p>I&#8217;ve jump-started you by putting <code>vaultpress.php</code> in there. Add plugin filenames to that array as necessary. Don&#8217;t forget that most plugins are in a subdirectory, so they&#8217;ll be in the form <code>plugin-name/plugin-name.php</code>.</p>\n<p>Now those plugins won&#8217;t be active when doing local dev (based on the presence of <code>local-config.php</code>).</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/645/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=645&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Jun 2011 11:17:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress.org Passwords Reset";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=10172";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/ibwz2aG09YE/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1461:"<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> team <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/06/passwords-reset/">noticed some suspicious changes</a> made to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/addthis/">AddThis</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/">WPtouch</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> plugins in <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">the official plugin directory</a>.

And get this: The workflow integrates seamlessly with InDesign, meaning the paper now has one content management system for both its web and print operations. And if you’re auspicious enough, you can do it too — he’s <strong>open-sourced all the code</strong>!</p>\n<p>Rather than having to pay a licensing fee to a company that runs your content management system, what The BDN has set up is essentially free to run. Of course, there were upfront costs involved with paying freelancers to help write the plugins, and each month the website has to pay hosting fees, but the rest of the tools they use are free for everyone. WordPress is open source software that anyone can download and use. Google Docs is also a free product if your organization is small enough.

We wanted to be able to get into the guts of our website if we needed to,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;We&#8217;re growing quickly online, so we wanted a platform that allowed us to develop and deploy easily and with speed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Through a series of plugins they developed specifically for their news site, and utilizing a few from the WordPress community, Bangor Daily News extended WordPress to do exactly what they needed it to do.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To us, that&#8217;s the beauty of WordPress: It&#8217;s more easily extendable than any other CMS. In nine months I haven&#8217;t hacked core once except to apply patches,&#8221; said Davis.</p>\n<p>Some of those plugins include, in Davis&#8217; words:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/zoninator/" target="_blank">Zoninator</a> (written by now-<a title="VentureBeat now on WordPress.com VIP" href="http://automattic.com/about">Automattician</a> Mo Jangda) that allows us to order posts in specific zones, such as the home page, instead of displaying them in reverse-chronological order. It&#8217;s a must-have for any publisher on WordPress and we&#8217;re very pleased he released it. I believe it will be available for WordPress.com VIP members soon.</li>\n<li>We use custom post types for quite a bit, including to power our <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact pages</a>, our <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/events/" target="_blank">events pages</a>, our <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/?post_type=slideshow" target="_blank">photo galleries</a>, our <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/?post_type=ugc" target="_blank">our user-contributed content</a> and our candidate pages for the election. Each of those are a separate plugin, and all will be open-sourced eventually.</li>\n<li>We use <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/terms-to-links/" target="_blank">Terms to Links</a>, which I built after being inspired by someone else&#8217;s plugins, to <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2011/06/07/politics/lepage-vetoes-foreign-loggers-bill/" target="_blank">automatically link</a> people, organizations and places to drive readers deeper into the site. Each of those are custom taxonomies.</li>\n<li>We use <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/edit-flow/" target="_blank">Edit Flow</a>, a CoPress project, to handle copy flow once it gets into WordPress. It&#8217;s another must-have.</li>\n<li>We use <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/media-credit/" target="_blank">Media Credit</a> to handle attribution for images.</li>\n<li>We use Automattic&#8217;s own <a href="http://polldaddy.com/" target="_blank">PollDaddy</a>, with a custom plugin on top of theirs, to handle <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/polls/" target="_blank">polls</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The changes to Bangor Daily News&#8217; editorial workflow have been immediate and dramatic, but they have also seen an increase in productivity regarding their development cycle, and their site has benefited with an increase in traffic, too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We started rolling things out in earnest in January, and the change has been dramatic. With one workflow with WordPress at the center we&#8217;ve cut down handling times for articles dramatically — we&#8217;re now able to get the news out faster than ever before. We&#8217;ve also seen a nice jump in search engine traffic thanks to more advanced URLs. Our build times are now down dramatically, as well — we can develop or patch features as quickly as they need to be addressed. The speed at which we break news requires a nimble API to develop with, and we&#8217;ve already been able to put it to the test, to great results.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They were also able to take advantage of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_API%27s">WordPress&#8217; APIs</a> to integrate everything and even publish back to the print version in InDesign, creating a truly seamless publishing system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of how deeply we&#8217;ve integrated WordPress into everything we do. Our stories start in Google Docs, where our reporters write and our editors edit. Those are seamlessly and automatically moved to WordPress when they&#8217;re ready to be published — no more copying and pasting. We also use <a href="https://github.com/bangordailynews/WordPress-xmlrpc-extenders" target="_blank">XML-RPC</a> to easily find and bring content onto the print page in InDesign. We custom-built an InDesign plugin to accomplish that.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://bangordailynews.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1577" title="bangornews" src="http://wordpresspublishers.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/bangornews.jpg?w=640&h=516" alt="" width="640" height="516" /></a><br />\nVisit <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/">Bangor Daily News</a></p>\n<p><em></em><strong><em><a href="http://get.wp.com/"><strong>Want WordPress for your site?

Last time we talked, I announced that I&#8217;d be stepping away and selling off everything I accomplished with this site and the podcast. I&#8217;m happy to report that not only have I sold the content I generated to an awesome buyer, they have requested that I continue about my business with WPTavern, the forum and the podcast as if nothing has happened. The only distinct change that has happened and will be the only thing to happen for the foreseeable future is that the site will be owned by someone else. I am in charge of maintaining and operating the site as I normally would. At the request of the new owner, the terms of the deal as well as who the new owner is is under wraps. </p>\n<p>So what this means is that I&#8217;ll be re-opening the forum as well as upgrading it to get it going again. I&#8217;ll also be conducting an episode or two of WordPress Weekly in the near future and I&#8217;ll be writing about WordPress again here on the site. I&#8217;m sticking around without any influence by the new owner as to what to write, say, or do. In all honesty, it&#8217;s a pretty weird deal on paper but it&#8217;s a deal that&#8217;s allowed me the greatest flexibility as well as allowing me to fulfill a couple of financial obligations that sprang up. For instance, I was recently able to put money down on a used truck. You don&#8217;t know how much you need a truck until you become a home owner!</p>\n<p>There is one change that I&#8217;ll be making. Thanks to the deal, I&#8217;m going to remove all display advertising from the site and will not need to pursue affiliate links in future reviews I do. While any additional income is great, writing without the weight of needing money is actually a huge weight off my shoulders. </p>\n<p>Before we get back to regular programming around here, I want to thank all of you for your comments on my good bye post. It became obvious that the audience of WPTavern values my work much more than I do. So many of you wanted me to stick around in some form or fashion while many of you were pretty darn sad to see WPWeekly to go by the wayside. It&#8217;s comments like those that convinced me of negotiating a deal that allowed me to stay on and manage the site.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not guaranteeing that I&#8217;ll be publishing posts or that I&#8217;ll be active in the forum every day or producing a podcast every weekend but I am guaranteeing that I&#8217;ll be behind the bar, taking your orders and continuing to talk about this thing called WordPress which is pretty cool publishing software. </p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/thanks-for-everything" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Thanks For Everything">Thanks For Everything</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wptavern-is-my-home-and-youre-just-a-guest" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WPTavern Is My Home And You&#8217;re Just A Guest">WPTavern Is My Home And You&#8217;re Just A Guest</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/J7a_UGSK-Ig" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Jun 2011 11:06:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"Mark Jaquith: How to write a WordPress plugin that I’ll use";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/?p=634";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/how-to-write-a-plugin-that-ill-use/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5631:"<p>I tend to be very fastidious about the WordPress plugins that I&#8217;ll install. I&#8217;ll often write my own simple version of a plugin rather than install one from someone else that does a bunch of stuff I don&#8217;t need. Here is my philosophy behind writing WordPress plugins, best witnessed through the plugins I&#8217;ve written lately, like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save/">Markdown on Save</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-logo/">Login Logo</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/monitor-pages/">Monitor Pages</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-help/">WP Help</a>.</p>\n<h3>Fewer features as a feature</h3>\n<p>There are diminishing returns as you add features. That is, the more you add, the more likely you&#8217;re adding something that X % of your plugin&#8217;s users won&#8217;t ever use. Stick to the basics. I&#8217;ll often release a &#8220;0.1&#8243; version of my plugin with really obvious features missing. When I get a flurry of &#8220;You should add Y!&#8221; messages, that validates my assumption that Y is necessary. Start with the smallest version that gets the core job done. Iterate as needed.</p>\n<h3>Code the hell out of it</h3>\n<p>The best part of starting small is that you can code the hell out of the plugin. Do it right. Make each line of code beautiful. Make sure you&#8217;re using WordPress APIs properly, and while you&#8217;re at it, add i18n support (WP Help 0.2 shipped with support for Bulgarian, German, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Macedonian, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, and Russian!)</p>\n<h3>Reduce UI</h3>\n<p>If you can do without UI, don&#8217;t make it. Make every bit of UI prove its necessity. As an example, look at my <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-logo/">Login Logo</a> plugin. It has zero UI. It looks for the presence of a file named <code>login-logo.png</code> in the <code>wp-content</code> directory. The rest is &#8220;magic.&#8221; It measures the image, generates appropriate CSS, and gives you an instantly and easily customized login screen. The plugin is invisible. It&#8217;s completely out of sight, and out of mind. Finally, UI screens are generally where plugin authors make security mistakes. By skipping them, you make it much more likely that your plugin is secure.</p>\n<h3>Code it for the future</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t use deprecated APIs. Plan features in future-forward ways. Implement it in such a way that a site that is using the plugin doesn&#8217;t break if the plugin suddenly goes away. One example of this is my <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save/">Markdown on Save</a> plugin, which offers per-post Markdown formatting. First, I decided that for performance reasons, I wanted to parse Markdown then the post was updated, not on display. The obvious place to store the generated HTML was in the <code>post_content_filtered</code> column that WordPress provides (but does not use). But then I considered what would happen if someone deactivated the plugin or deleted the plugin. The code that accessed <code>post_content_filtered</code> would not work. Their blog would spit out raw Markdown. And any exports they made would export raw Markdown. What if they were exporting to WordPress.com which doesn&#8217;t support Markdown? So I decided to store the <em>Markdown</em> in <code>post_content_filtered</code>, and store the generated HTML in <code>post_content</code>. When you edit a Markdown-formatted post, it swaps in the Markdown, so you can edit that. But if you deactivated the plugin, it would fall back to the HTML. So you can feel free to use this plugin and know that if one day you wake up and you hate Markdown, all you have to do is deactivate the plugin and all of your posts are back to HTML.</p>\n<h3>Secure it</h3>\n<p>Writing secure WordPress plugins isn&#8217;t hard. It just takes awareness. Take the time to do your research and code a plugin that will be an asset to its users, not a liability.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow"

We released <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/">Beta 1</a> thirteen days ago, and today we&#8217;re putting out Beta 2 for your testing pleasure.</p>\n<p>This is still beta software, so <strong>we don&#8217;t recommend that you use it on production sites</strong>. But if you&#8217;re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, <strong>you should be running this on your test environments</strong> and <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs">reporting any bugs</a> you find. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress&#8217; famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. Let us know what you think!</p>\n<p>The plan is to start putting out release candidates in early June, and to release WordPress 3.2 by the end of the month. The more you help us iron out issues during the beta period, the more likely we are to hit those dates. To misappropriate and mangle a quote from Mahatma Gandhi: &#8220;Be the punctuality you want to see in the WordPress.&#8221; In other words, test now!</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things that changed since Beta 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google Chrome Frame</a> is now supported in the admin, if you have it installed. This is especially useful for IE 6 users (remember, IE 6 is otherwise deprecated for the admin).</li>\n<li>The admin is less ugly in IE 7.</li>\n<li>The blue admin color scheme has caught up to the grey one, and is ready for testing.</li>\n<li>We are now bundling jQuery 1.6.1. You should test any JS that uses jQuery. WordPress JavaScript guru Andrew Ozz has <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/jquery-updates-in-wordpress-3-2/">a post with more info</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.2-beta2.zip">Download WordPress 3.2 Beta 2</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-1-3/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"WordPress 3.2, Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 May 2011 08:22:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=1816";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:351:"It seems like just yesterday that we released WordPress 3.1, but it&#8217;s actually been almost three months.

This isn&#8217;t a major redesign, just a little facelift to keep us feeling young. WordPress turns 8 later this month, you know.</li>\n<li><strong>New Default Theme</strong>. Introducing Twenty Eleven, based on the popular Duster theme. Rotating header images, post format support, and more.</li>\n<li><strong><a href="http://browsehappy.com">Browse Happy</a></strong>.

Here are the WordCamps that have been approved so far for the summer:</p>\n<p>April 16: <a href="http://wordcampseattle.org/">WordCamp Seattle</a> in Seattle, WA. This weekend! After taking a year off, WordCamp Seattle is back with tracks for bloggers, designers, and developers. This year they&#8217;ll feature a lineup including presentations by both local speakers and visitors like core committer Andrew Nacin, as well as an Ignite session of lightning talks at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>May 5: <a href="http://wordcampdevelopers.com/">WordCamp Vancouver (Developer Edition)</a> in Vancouver, BC. This one-day WordCamp is aimed purely at developers working on the WordPress platform, and will not have content aimed at bloggers (as previous Vancouver WordCamps have). I predict we will start seeing more of these types of niche WordCamps moving forward, because they will mean smaller, more intimate events that allow more collaboration (and make it easier to find venues!). Note that we&#8217;re working with the organizers to get the tickets to a more reasonable price, so keep your eyes open this week if you&#8217;ve held off on buying a ticket because of the price tag.</p>\n<p>May 7: <a href="http://wordcamp-switzerland.ch/">WordCamp Switzerland</a> in Brugg, Switzerland. This one will cover a wide range of topics, including getting started with WordPress, advanced development topics, BuddyPress, and an inside look at running a WordPress-based business.</p>\n<p>May 14: <a href="http://www.ocwordcamp.com/">WordCamp Orange County</a> in Orange, CA. Already sold out! Orange County had their first WordCamp last year, and the organizers have put together another great event this time around.</p>\n<p>May 14: <a href="http://paris14mai2011.wordcamp.fr/">WordCamp Paris</a> in Paris, France. One of the last true unconference-style WordCamps, the Paris group will plan their schedule the morning of the event like they do at BarCamps. WordCamp Paris had one of the best WordCamp t-shirts ever a couple of years ago. And it&#8217;s in Paris in the spring.</p>\n<p>May 21–22: <a href="http://wordcampraleigh.com/">WordCamp Raleigh</a> in Raleigh, NC. Repeat organizers from the Raleigh WordPress Meetup Group are just starting to select speakers and put together their plans, but if it is anything like last year, the venue will be packed with WordPress professionals (and maybe there will be cookies). I&#8217;ll be attending this one, as will Nacin.</p>\n<p>June 4–5: <a href="http://2011.reno.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Reno-Lake Tahoe</a> in Reno, NV. Organized by a WordPress core UI group contributor, WordCamp Reno-Lake Tahoe is taking place in Reno and has a packed schedule full of visiting experts.</p>\n<p>June 11–12: <a href="http://www.wckansascity.org/">WordCamp Kansas City</a> in Overland Park, KS. With publisher, designer, and developer tracks, Kansas City&#8217;s WordCamp will have a little something for everyone, presented in large part by local speakers.</p>\n<p>June 17–19: <a href="http://wordcampcolumbus.com/">WordCamp Columbus</a> in Columbus, OH. WordCamp Columbus has a new organizer this year and is bringing the focus more firmly onto WordPress (and less on social media). Their 3-day event includes an entire day for newbies, and another for non-profits, a nice addition to the usual blogger/developer tracks.</p>\n<p>July 9–10: <a href="http://wcmtl.org/">WordCamp Montreal</a> in Montreal, Quebec. This group consistently puts on a great every year. If you register now, you can still get a $10 discount and get both days for only $30 (with sessions in both English and French to reflect the bilingual nature of the city). Montreal plays host to a number of <a href="http://www.montreal.com/tourism/festivals/index.html">festivals</a> throughout the year, and this weekend is no different, including festivals for the arts, comedy, tango, and even circus arts.</p>\n<p>July 16: <a href="http://2011.sandiego.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Diego</a> in San Diego, CA. First WordCamp in San Diego! They have talking about this for over a year, and are now starting to really ramp up the planning. They&#8217;re finalizing their venue right now, and I would expect a great roster of speakers.</p>\n<p>July 16-17: <a href="http://wiki.wordcampuk.org/Main_Page">WordCamp Portsmouth</a> in Portsmouth, UK. The annual WordCamp UK that moves from city to city each year alights this year in Portsmouth. This one is notable because Mike Little, co-founder of WordPress, is part of the organizing team.</p>\n<p>July 23–24: <a href="http://wordcampboston.com/">WordCamp Boston</a> in Boston, MA. Another one just about to lock down some details and get starting with speaker selection, etc. An easy train ride from so many places, and not in the middle of winter this year!</p>\n<p>July 30-31: <a href="http://2011.chicago.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Chicago</a> has new organizers and is a new venue this year. A call for speakers, supporters, and volunteers will likely be posted sometime next week.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.wordcampportland.org/">WordCamp Portland</a> is looking for a venue before deciding on a date this year, as it has outgrown the space it&#8217;s used the past two years, but hopes to happen in September. If you would be interested in donating a venue to this popular event, please <a href="http://www.wordcampportland.org/">contact them</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll hold off on posting fall events until later in the summer since there a lot in the planning stages now.

Because, they are leading the biggest study ever of the rare disease called Selective Eating Disorder, of which I am one of 1,400 known sufferers.\r\n\r\nWhat is the disease? I don’t know anything about it.\r\n\r\nMost people don’t know anything about it. Very little is known about it, but Duke is leading the way in research on it. Basically, Selective Eating Disorder is exactly what it sounds like: people who suffer from it are extremely selective about the foods they eat. Me, for example, I’m only able to eat about 20 different foods. It’s a compulsion of some kind, it’s kind of like, one of the theories is that it could be related to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. And I’ve only just found out that it existed recently, I’ve lived with it for my whole life—me and my family have lived with it for my whole life—and I just thought that I was the weirdest dude in the world, but it turns out that there are at least 1,400 of us that exist. And I’m really pumped that Duke is leading the way trying to get more knowledge about it, maybe we can, hopefully someday soon there’ll be some sort of effective treatment. Because, it is crazy, it’s one of the craziest diseases. It’s quite the mystery, and I feel good knowing that such a fine university as Duke has got their team working on unraveling it, I can’t wait to see what they come up with it.\r\n\r\nFirst thing I wanted to ask you: how did you end up in this Ted Leo video that just came out, the “Bottled in Cork” video?\r\n\r\nWell, Ted and I, we know each other a little bit, having gone on tour together and stuff, so we’d been texting, trying to schedule some kind of, like, hanging-out time, because he’s usually sometimes the guy I go to for fatherly advice about punk stuff. We ended up not ever having this meeting but, in the course of our texting, he revealed that he was going to be in New York and was going to do this music video in Brooklyn where I happen to live. So you know, he just said, come by at four o clock, we’re doing this video, and pretty much the rest is history.\r\n\r\nIt was really funny, it came out really well.\r\n\r\nYeah, that video’s pretty awesome.\r\n\r\nYeah, so I’ll ask you some more substantial questions now, but I was curious about that. So, first off. The Monitor is distinguished, basically, to me by the fact that there are almost no repeated lyrics on the album. You guys don’t really do choruses, you don’t really do traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. There are the chants, like “The enemy is everywhere,” “You’ll always be a loser,” that sort of stuff, but the feel is very literary, very poetic. I was curious how you got into that sort of writing style, why you decided to write in that sort of longer, sequential way, instead of doing the verse-chorus-verse thing.\r\n\r\nWell, I guess it all began with the band Neutral Milk Hotel. You know, their work, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, one of my very favorites, probably the greatest album ever. And that record didn’t have any repeated refrains on it, I observed one day. I hadn’t been too interested in that sort of stuff before, anyway, but upon noticing that they didn’t do it at all, I felt pretty firm in my resolve that choruses are probably pretty unnecessary for the most part, you know? If you say something once, why say it again. I just don’t find it the most effective means to communicate my ideas. Furthermore, if you don’t do it all the time, hopefully the result will be that when you do do it, the device will be a little more potent, if you don’t overdo it. If you don’t repeat too much stuff, hopefully when you do repeat something, people will get the idea that maybe this is kind of a takeaway point. So, if we’re gonna repeat something, it’s gotta be a point that we really gotta hammer home, rather than just having something that’s easy to remember and sing along to, although that is important. There’s a lot to say, there’s a lot that we’re trying to communicate, and we can’t really afford to give up that much lyrical real-estate.\r\n\r\nIt’s funny, because I got to interview Dan McGee—\r\n\r\nOh my God, the greatest living genius of American song!\r\n\r\n(Laughs) Dude is good, I remember when I saw you guys play at Local 506 with Spider Bags, I remember you opened up with, We’re happy to be here with Spider Bags, the greatest band in the world. But I asked him about coming up and doing the verse on “Theme from Cheers,” and he said, Yeah, Patrick’s got a lot to say (laughs).\r\n\r\nIt’s a wide and wondrous world of ideas, you know? But little do I have to say than Spider Bags being the greatest band in the world. Which I say again now, and I’m being as unfacetious as I was then. Again, I remain steadfast.\r\n\r\nYou knew Dan when he was in DC Snipers, right, well before Spider Bags?\r\n\r\nYes sir, although I didn’t know him as well as I do now. I met him a few times when he was playing the DC Snipers, that’s true, that was my introduction to him. Me and my friend Sarem, who plays in a band called Liquor Store, happened to go see the DC Snipers open for the Black Lips at this little place in New York called Siberia, and it was pretty much love at first sight, especially since they were all from New Jersey, and we were young New Jersey punk rockers at the time in need of some role models—probably couldn’t have picked five worse ones than the DC Snipers but that’s ok.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think it is about New Jersey that has this presence in so much music, and so much—it goes beyond music too, because you’ve got Philip Roth with the Newark trope and it’s, Jersey’s everywhere. What is it about that state that is so resonant with artists?\r\n\r\nWell, New Jersey does have a really strong literary tradition. Don’t forget Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, too, though I guess those guys are long dead. It’s the underdog, the longshot, the dude that everybody’s already counted out, you know?. People in New Jersey, we get s*** on all the time from all sides, everybody thinks we’re the armpit of America, that we stink. They drive on the New Jersey Turnpike and they smell the Meadowlands and they think that New Jersey is just the s***hole. Or they see us on TV, in our wifebeaters with our gold chains and our pink tans and our blowouts and they think they know everything about us, and New Jersey’s just a big f****** cesspool, and it’s just where America dumps off its garbage. So everybody pretty much thinks they’ve got New Jersey figured out. And nobody likes that, nobody wants to get put in a box, nobody wants to have somebody’s opinion of them decided before they know anything about them. So that’s kind of the thing, everybody from New Jersey wants something better for themselves, because we’ve got a little bit of an inferiority complex too, everybody from New Jersey’s always singing about, oh, we’ve got to escape, we’ve got to be born to run, we’ve got to live on a prayer and all this, we’ve got to cast off the chains, the shackles of our regional identity, cause you know we all dream of bigger and better things than New Jersey can afford us. But I mean, it’s all nonsense, right? It’s like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it, right?\r\n\r\nIt’s lines on a map.\r\n\r\nYeah. But I will certainly say that, the New Jersey that’s being force-fed to America right now through our popular culture is most certainly not the New Jersey that I grew up in and not really the New Jersey that we sing about in our more hopeful moments.\r\n\r\nThat’s good to hear. It definitely seems to haunt slash hover over your music. I mean, “A More Perfect Union” has both “Looking for a new New Jersey” and “I never should have left New Jersey.” So it’s almost like this conflictedness about it.\r\n\r\nThey’re equally true, right? They’re equally valid and equally invalid. At that point in the story, our hero hasn’t really learned the value of internal validation, you know? Our hero casts about for sources of peace and fulfillment from the outside world. What a f****** mistake.\r\n\r\nDoes our hero learn the value of internal validation by the end of the album, do you think?\r\n\r\nWell, sort of, it’s implicit. The road that lays ahead of our hero remains long and arduous, but our hero has learned a little something about personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the environment that our hero is passing through on this album, the war imagery is there from the title, it’s there in the song titles, it’s all over the place. What is it about battle and the idea of war that resonates so much with you, why is it so symbolic? The metaphor seems to extend to mental health, to relationships, it’s all over the place.\r\n\r\nTo be a human, to live amongst other humans is to be constantly in conflict, we never are able to f****** get along. Sometimes it ends up with us killing each other in enormous numbers, other times we just turn up our noses at each other. It’s a story that’s as old as human interaction. Even though we have the same wants and needs more or less, we always find some way to pit ourselves against another. The classic self-other relationship, that kind of way that we view the world, the way that we put ourselves in opposition to some kind of real or imagined oppressor, you know? The human inability to define oneself positively, right? To look inward for our validation and our values and our definitions of success, right? Every human has the power, the right and the responsibility to determine those things for ourselves, but for a lot of us that is too heavy a responsibility and it’s easier to look outward and say, if not for so and so, if not for this guy or that guy I’d be happy as a clam. But as it is, I’m stranded here amongst all the little people and I’m f****** miserable. It follows that the answer to eliminating that misery is eliminating the other human, or if not eliminating him, taking away his or her freedoms so we can have more freedoms to ourselves, which is of course all a lot of hogwash. It consistently does more harm than good, as evidence by the untold thousands of Americans that fill the battlefields of our horrific civil war, 150 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt’s that idea that life’s a zero-sum game, where if one guy’s got something then you can’t have that something because he’s already got it and it all has to balance out.\r\n\r\nYeah, it’s crazy. Freedoms are renewable resources, and it’s kind of a self-generating thing, the more of it that gets spread around— I don’t know man, us humans are f***** up.\r\n\r\nIt’s a complicated issue, that’s for sure.\r\n\r\nYeah, definitely. Probably the most complicated issue that yet has existed: how to get we humans to get along. The person who figures out is going to be a wealthy man. Or woman. Or transgender.\r\n\r\nLeave all the options open.\r\n\r\nCould be anybody.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. So, you guys, in your music, your lyrics especially, there’s artistic references all over the place, and it’s both high art and quote-unqoute low art, which doesn’t really exist. But, you know, Fortress of Solitude, Brueghel, Camus, Whitman.  What are you like as a consumer of art: do you read a lot, what are you interested in?\r\n\r\nOh, you know, pretty much everything, right? This world is so full of ideas. A really bad way to get smarter is to draw arbitrary lines across our culture, to say that one piece of information is more valuable than another. The people that are going to define where our culture goes are going to be the ones that are best able to straddle that completely made-up line between high and low culture. Because from either side of that line there’s countless wondrous things to learn, and things that can enhance our earthly experience. To cut yourself off from any of them is doing yourself a great disservice. We’re the most blessed generation of humans that’s every lived, as far as our access to information and stuff. We should be the smartest humans of all time. And we probably can be if we decide that we want to. Wouldn’t you say, Kev?\r\n\r\nI couldn’t agree more. You do a little bit of that involvement with all of these spoken-word passages on the album and the quoting, it informs the album really well I think. It’s cool that you had those guests read those parts. What made you want to get guys like Craig Finn involved, other than the fact that Craig Finn is just a really great dude—what made you want to pull in all these other guys to read these parts and not just read them yourself, or have someone else in the band read them?\r\n\r\nWell, it’s kind of a more the merrier thing. I’m very blessed to have accumulated, as my friends, probably the most talented people in the world, and I would be remiss if I didn’t make the best possible use of their multitudes of talents for my own selfish purposes. It’s like I said, the more the merrier. Friendly, neighborly thing, trying to foster that inclusive environment, the communal element that’s so vital to punk. Even though there’s only five people in the band right now, we’re not trying to have some kind of inclusive club.\r\n\r\nYeah, there’s a great community aspect to Titus Andronicus, you guys are really inclusive it seems like.\r\n\r\nThat’s what it’s all about, you know? Too much of our f****** modern world is so exclusive. Everybody gets a hard-on when they can have something that they can keep hidden away from somebody else. What a f****** dumbass thing to do. Community, inclusiveness is the opposite of that, and that’s pretty much what we’re interested in.\r\n\r\nYou seem like a very genuine guy. You don’t seem to spend a lot of time saying things that you don’t truly believe.\r\n\r\nNo, what the f*** would be the point of that, that would be the dumbest thing I could do. I only have so much time on this Earth, I don’t have any time to speak falsities, you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nYeah, I appreciate that. How important—because it took me a really long to figure out a good idea of how The Monitor’s concept went from beginning to end—how important do you think it is for listeners to know that story, to know that there is a hero and these things are happening to him?\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, that’s not really for me to say. We put it out into the world—our part of the interpretation process is pretty much over. I can talk to you now and say what I meant and hopefully you can tell the kids about it, but for the most part, when you put something out into the world you kind of have to let go of your control over it, people are going to take it and do with it what they will, you know? Sometimes people seem to really get the idea and sometimes people communicate to me by their words and actions that they have no idea what we’re talking about, or completely don’t give a s*** about it. I don’t know man, look at Fugazi, Fugazi couldn’t possibly have been more to the point, and for their whole career they had to fight against people having totally the hundred-percent wrong idea about what they were doing. So like, f***, if Fugazi couldn’t pull it off, what chance do we have? Probably close to zero. I hate to be misunderstood, but that’s kind of, if you want to be a human and interact with another human that’s pretty much inevitable, right?\r\n\r\nI know exactly what you’re talking about, because I’ve read a lot about the album that gets really hung up on the idea of it being this depressing, dark, kind of relentless piece. I personally have always thought the album was really beautiful and quite uplifting, especially by the end: there’s some definite optimism there. I think people hear a certain tone and they don’t look past it.\r\n\r\nThere have been huge misconstruings. Like our song, “Theme from Cheers,” for example, the seventh song on that record, that was supposed to be our hero’s most pitiful moment, but now it seems like, people have got the idea that it’s about how getting wasted’s awesome, and that wasn’t the idea at all. But that’s kind of like, what the f*** are you gonna do, right? You can’t hold peoples’ hands every time that they want to listen to your record. They’re gonna get out of it what they’re gonna get out of it, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThat’s really surprising, because that song, it’s a fantastic song, but that’s where the album is definitely a little darker and depressing, because you get really into the specifics of how down in the bender this guy is.\r\n\r\nPretty serious debasement happening.\r\n\r\nYeah, the whole cigarette butts lining his throat, that’s not exactly a beautiful image, I mean it’s a great image but it’s not…\r\n\r\nThat was funny, my sister was telling me the other day that she and my mother were listening to that song and that line came up and my mom was like, Do you think he really does that?\r\n\r\n(Laughs) I imagine they’ve had pretty opinionated reactions to the line where you’re like, Sorry Dad, no, I’m not making this up.\r\n\r\nYeah. Got to keep it real, whatever the cost. But, you know, I guess the flip-side of that is that, as with any sort of art, my intentions are, if they are followed to the letter, that is not necessarily the most productive interpretation for an individual listener. So I hope that on the flip-side of people getting the wrong idea, that they get something out of it that’s positive even if that’s not what I had in mind. Like, I got this really sweet Facebook message from this kid, some stranger, but he said that the album really encapsulated what it meant to be 18, and I was like s***, I thought I was trying to encapsulate what it meant to be 23. But you know, that guy was a slightly happier person for having this album that he thought was all about being 18 years old and that’s fine too, you know? At the end of the day, the purpose is just generating greater positivity, and whatever way that I can do that, so be it. I don’t think that getting wasted is the thing, but hopefully more positivity will come out of the record’s existence on this earth, rather than negativity. That’s always the idea, right, this record’s got to be utilitarian.\r\n\r\nOne part of the album that I kind of caught onto and that I’ve read you talking about a little bit is how you’re talking about antidepressants in that part that’s like, Robot inside of my head, that almost controlling force of this pill. You say at one point that you can’t do anything without its permission; do you really think that that sort of medication is kind of leading people to becoming sort of extra-human, like it’s something beyond natural life?\r\n\r\nOoh, interesting. Well, my opinion about my medicine has kind of changed since I wrote that song. I was really confused about the idea of the authenticity of emotions. But since then, I’ve kind of decided that, all that I know of the universe is my perceptions. Nothing’s good or bad, but thinking makes it so, as Hamlet says. So you know, I’m a 21st century man, and once more I exist at the center of my personal universe, I’m the master of my domain, as an existentialist I’m in control of my destiny. So I might as well tailor my emotions to being the most productive possible. But I guess it’s an ongoing something, because I do believe that we have to be unafraid to embrace the extremes of our human experience, whether that be the most exalted joys or the most horrific despairs. But it’s tough, sometimes it’s too scary. I don’t know man, it’s tough. Like Nietzsche says, humanity is something to be overcome, and I do believe that my medicine has made me a more productive person, a better person. Who’s to say that one way of pursuing that is better than another. For some people it’s taking SSRIs, for other people it’s booze, for other people it’s sexual conquest. Everything that we pursue in life is a means to a greater level of happiness for us, whatever that is. It’s all equally valid, they’re all inherently without any value, so might as well pick the one that works for me, I guess. But I guess there is still a little bit of shame instilled in me from not being able to do it all on my own. But I know that that’s just me, my programming, my having been brainwashed by a society that wants to keep people that suffer from any sort of mental illness at the bottom of the ladder, just like we try to do with anybody that’s different in any kind of noticeable way. I’m looking to deprogram myself about that.\r\n\r\nYou definitely seem to place a lot of emphasis on the process, whatever the process may be, of how people are trying to reach happiness or satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWell, you know, the authenticity of emotion—as an existentialist I believe that we, as individuals, decide what our authentic self is. Practically speaking, it’s probably ok, I’m probably going to keep taking them (laughs). Dude, it is a f****** awesome drug, it really did pretty much exactly what it said it was gonna do. How many products can you say that about these days?\r\n\r\nYou seem to identify pretty strongly as an existentialist then?\r\n\r\nYeah, I’ve mentioned that a few times, haven’t I? I guess it is pretty much my religion. I am striving to create my authentic self in the context of this crazy, absurd universe.\r\n\r\nSounds like a rational instinct to me.\r\n\r\nIt’s the best, because out of the hopelessness of our absurd universe comes absolute freedom, right? Because I exist in a universe that is enormous, that will squish me like the bug I am at some point sooner rather than later. But the other side of that coin is that I exist at the center of my own universe over which I exude total control as far as determining what my values are, what my definition of success is, and what it means for me to be a good person. And what greater currency can there be than that, in this crazy modern world?

Because, they are leading the biggest study ever of the rare disease called Selective Eating Disorder, of which I am one of 1,400 known sufferers.\n\nWhat is the disease? I don’t know anything about it.\n\nMost people don’t know anything about it. Very little is known about it, but Duke is leading the way in research on it. Basically, Selective Eating Disorder is exactly what it sounds like: people who suffer from it are extremely selective about the foods they eat. Me, for example, I’m only able to eat about 20 different foods. It’s a compulsion of some kind, it’s kind of like, one of the theories is that it could be related to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. And I’ve only just found out that it existed recently, I’ve lived with it for my whole life—me and my family have lived with it for my whole life—and I just thought that I was the weirdest dude in the world, but it turns out that there are at least 1,400 of us that exist. And I’m really pumped that Duke is leading the way trying to get more knowledge about it, maybe we can, hopefully someday soon there’ll be some sort of effective treatment. Because, it is crazy, it’s one of the craziest diseases. It’s quite the mystery, and I feel good knowing that such a fine university as Duke has got their team working on unraveling it, I can’t wait to see what they come up with it.\n\nFirst thing I wanted to ask you: how did you end up in this Ted Leo video that just came out, the “Bottled in Cork” video?\n\nWell, Ted and I, we know each other a little bit, having gone on tour together and stuff, so we’d been texting, trying to schedule some kind of, like, hanging-out time, because he’s usually sometimes the guy I go to for fatherly advice about punk stuff. We ended up not ever having this meeting but, in the course of our texting, he revealed that he was going to be in New York and was going to do this music video in Brooklyn where I happen to live. So you know, he just said, come by at four o clock, we’re doing this video, and pretty much the rest is history.\n\nIt was really funny, it came out really well.\n\nYeah, that video’s pretty awesome.\n\nYeah, so I’ll ask you some more substantial questions now, but I was curious about that. So, first off. The Monitor is distinguished, basically, to me by the fact that there are almost no repeated lyrics on the album. You guys don’t really do choruses, you don’t really do traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. There are the chants, like “The enemy is everywhere,” “You’ll always be a loser,” that sort of stuff, but the feel is very literary, very poetic. I was curious how you got into that sort of writing style, why you decided to write in that sort of longer, sequential way, instead of doing the verse-chorus-verse thing.\n\nWell, I guess it all began with the band Neutral Milk Hotel. You know, their work, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, one of my very favorites, probably the greatest album ever. And that record didn’t have any repeated refrains on it, I observed one day. I hadn’t been too interested in that sort of stuff before, anyway, but upon noticing that they didn’t do it at all, I felt pretty firm in my resolve that choruses are probably pretty unnecessary for the most part, you know? If you say something once, why say it again. I just don’t find it the most effective means to communicate my ideas. Furthermore, if you don’t do it all the time, hopefully the result will be that when you do do it, the device will be a little more potent, if you don’t overdo it. If you don’t repeat too much stuff, hopefully when you do repeat something, people will get the idea that maybe this is kind of a takeaway point. So, if we’re gonna repeat something, it’s gotta be a point that we really gotta hammer home, rather than just having something that’s easy to remember and sing along to, although that is important. There’s a lot to say, there’s a lot that we’re trying to communicate, and we can’t really afford to give up that much lyrical real-estate.\n\nIt’s funny, because I got to interview Dan McGee—\n\nOh my God, the greatest living genius of American song!\n\n(Laughs) Dude is good, I remember when I saw you guys play at Local 506 with Spider Bags, I remember you opened up with, We’re happy to be here with Spider Bags, the greatest band in the world. But I asked him about coming up and doing the verse on “Theme from Cheers,” and he said, Yeah, Patrick’s got a lot to say (laughs).\n\nIt’s a wide and wondrous world of ideas, you know? But little do I have to say than Spider Bags being the greatest band in the world. Which I say again now, and I’m being as unfacetious as I was then. Again, I remain steadfast.\n\nYou knew Dan when he was in DC Snipers, right, well before Spider Bags?\n\nYes sir, although I didn’t know him as well as I do now. I met him a few times when he was playing the DC Snipers, that’s true, that was my introduction to him. Me and my friend Sarem, who plays in a band called Liquor Store, happened to go see the DC Snipers open for the Black Lips at this little place in New York called Siberia, and it was pretty much love at first sight, especially since they were all from New Jersey, and we were young New Jersey punk rockers at the time in need of some role models—probably couldn’t have picked five worse ones than the DC Snipers but that’s ok.\n\nWhat do you think it is about New Jersey that has this presence in so much music, and so much—it goes beyond music too, because you’ve got Philip Roth with the Newark trope and it’s, Jersey’s everywhere. What is it about that state that is so resonant with artists?\n\nWell, New Jersey does have a really strong literary tradition. Don’t forget Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, too, though I guess those guys are long dead. It’s the underdog, the longshot, the dude that everybody’s already counted out, you know?. People in New Jersey, we get s*** on all the time from all sides, everybody thinks we’re the armpit of America, that we stink. They drive on the New Jersey Turnpike and they smell the Meadowlands and they think that New Jersey is just the s***hole. Or they see us on TV, in our wifebeaters with our gold chains and our pink tans and our blowouts and they think they know everything about us, and New Jersey’s just a big f****** cesspool, and it’s just where America dumps off its garbage. So everybody pretty much thinks they’ve got New Jersey figured out. And nobody likes that, nobody wants to get put in a box, nobody wants to have somebody’s opinion of them decided before they know anything about them. So that’s kind of the thing, everybody from New Jersey wants something better for themselves, because we’ve got a little bit of an inferiority complex too, everybody from New Jersey’s always singing about, oh, we’ve got to escape, we’ve got to be born to run, we’ve got to live on a prayer and all this, we’ve got to cast off the chains, the shackles of our regional identity, cause you know we all dream of bigger and better things than New Jersey can afford us. But I mean, it’s all nonsense, right? It’s like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it, right?\n\nIt’s lines on a map.\n\nYeah. But I will certainly say that, the New Jersey that’s being force-fed to America right now through our popular culture is most certainly not the New Jersey that I grew up in and not really the New Jersey that we sing about in our more hopeful moments.\n\nThat’s good to hear. It definitely seems to haunt slash hover over your music. I mean, “A More Perfect Union” has both “Looking for a new New Jersey” and “I never should have left New Jersey.” So it’s almost like this conflictedness about it.\n\nThey’re equally true, right? They’re equally valid and equally invalid. At that point in the story, our hero hasn’t really learned the value of internal validation, you know? Our hero casts about for sources of peace and fulfillment from the outside world. What a f****** mistake.\n\nDoes our hero learn the value of internal validation by the end of the album, do you think?\n\nWell, sort of, it’s implicit. The road that lays ahead of our hero remains long and arduous, but our hero has learned a little something about personal responsibility.\n\nSpeaking of the environment that our hero is passing through on this album, the war imagery is there from the title, it’s there in the song titles, it’s all over the place. What is it about battle and the idea of war that resonates so much with you, why is it so symbolic? The metaphor seems to extend to mental health, to relationships, it’s all over the place.\n\nTo be a human, to live amongst other humans is to be constantly in conflict, we never are able to f****** get along. Sometimes it ends up with us killing each other in enormous numbers, other times we just turn up our noses at each other. It’s a story that’s as old as human interaction. Even though we have the same wants and needs more or less, we always find some way to pit ourselves against another. The classic self-other relationship, that kind of way that we view the world, the way that we put ourselves in opposition to some kind of real or imagined oppressor, you know? The human inability to define oneself positively, right? To look inward for our validation and our values and our definitions of success, right? Every human has the power, the right and the responsibility to determine those things for ourselves, but for a lot of us that is too heavy a responsibility and it’s easier to look outward and say, if not for so and so, if not for this guy or that guy I’d be happy as a clam. But as it is, I’m stranded here amongst all the little people and I’m f****** miserable. It follows that the answer to eliminating that misery is eliminating the other human, or if not eliminating him, taking away his or her freedoms so we can have more freedoms to ourselves, which is of course all a lot of hogwash. It consistently does more harm than good, as evidence by the untold thousands of Americans that fill the battlefields of our horrific civil war, 150 years ago.\n\nIt’s that idea that life’s a zero-sum game, where if one guy’s got something then you can’t have that something because he’s already got it and it all has to balance out.\n\nYeah, it’s crazy. Freedoms are renewable resources, and it’s kind of a self-generating thing, the more of it that gets spread around— I don’t know man, us humans are f***** up.\n\nIt’s a complicated issue, that’s for sure.\n\nYeah, definitely. Probably the most complicated issue that yet has existed: how to get we humans to get along. The person who figures out is going to be a wealthy man. Or woman. Or transgender.\n\nLeave all the options open.\n\nCould be anybody.\n\nAbsolutely. So, you guys, in your music, your lyrics especially, there’s artistic references all over the place, and it’s both high art and quote-unqoute low art, which doesn’t really exist. But, you know, Fortress of Solitude, Brueghel, Camus, Whitman.  What are you like as a consumer of art: do you read a lot, what are you interested in?\n\nOh, you know, pretty much everything, right? This world is so full of ideas. A really bad way to get smarter is to draw arbitrary lines across our culture, to say that one piece of information is more valuable than another. The people that are going to define where our culture goes are going to be the ones that are best able to straddle that completely made-up line between high and low culture. Because from either side of that line there’s countless wondrous things to learn, and things that can enhance our earthly experience. To cut yourself off from any of them is doing yourself a great disservice. We’re the most blessed generation of humans that’s every lived, as far as our access to information and stuff. We should be the smartest humans of all time. And we probably can be if we decide that we want to. Wouldn’t you say, Kev?\n\nI couldn’t agree more. You do a little bit of that involvement with all of these spoken-word passages on the album and the quoting, it informs the album really well I think. It’s cool that you had those guests read those parts. What made you want to get guys like Craig Finn involved, other than the fact that Craig Finn is just a really great dude—what made you want to pull in all these other guys to read these parts and not just read them yourself, or have someone else in the band read them?\n\nWell, it’s kind of a more the merrier thing. I’m very blessed to have accumulated, as my friends, probably the most talented people in the world, and I would be remiss if I didn’t make the best possible use of their multitudes of talents for my own selfish purposes. It’s like I said, the more the merrier. Friendly, neighborly thing, trying to foster that inclusive environment, the communal element that’s so vital to punk. Even though there’s only five people in the band right now, we’re not trying to have some kind of inclusive club.\n\nYeah, there’s a great community aspect to Titus Andronicus, you guys are really inclusive it seems like.\n\nThat’s what it’s all about, you know? Too much of our f****** modern world is so exclusive. Everybody gets a hard-on when they can have something that they can keep hidden away from somebody else. What a f****** dumbass thing to do. Community, inclusiveness is the opposite of that, and that’s pretty much what we’re interested in.\n\nYou seem like a very genuine guy. You don’t seem to spend a lot of time saying things that you don’t truly believe.\n\nNo, what the f*** would be the point of that, that would be the dumbest thing I could do. I only have so much time on this Earth, I don’t have any time to speak falsities, you know what I mean?\n\nYeah, I appreciate that. How important—because it took me a really long to figure out a good idea of how The Monitor’s concept went from beginning to end—how important do you think it is for listeners to know that story, to know that there is a hero and these things are happening to him?\n\nWell, I mean, that’s not really for me to say. We put it out into the world—our part of the interpretation process is pretty much over. I can talk to you now and say what I meant and hopefully you can tell the kids about it, but for the most part, when you put something out into the world you kind of have to let go of your control over it, people are going to take it and do with it what they will, you know? Sometimes people seem to really get the idea and sometimes people communicate to me by their words and actions that they have no idea what we’re talking about, or completely don’t give a s*** about it. I don’t know man, look at Fugazi, Fugazi couldn’t possibly have been more to the point, and for their whole career they had to fight against people having totally the hundred-percent wrong idea about what they were doing. So like, f***, if Fugazi couldn’t pull it off, what chance do we have? Probably close to zero. I hate to be misunderstood, but that’s kind of, if you want to be a human and interact with another human that’s pretty much inevitable, right?\n\nI know exactly what you’re talking about, because I’ve read a lot about the album that gets really hung up on the idea of it being this depressing, dark, kind of relentless piece. I personally have always thought the album was really beautiful and quite uplifting, especially by the end: there’s some definite optimism there. I think people hear a certain tone and they don’t look past it.\n\nThere have been huge misconstruings. Like our song, “Theme from Cheers,” for example, the seventh song on that record, that was supposed to be our hero’s most pitiful moment, but now it seems like, people have got the idea that it’s about how getting wasted’s awesome, and that wasn’t the idea at all. But that’s kind of like, what the f*** are you gonna do, right? You can’t hold peoples’ hands every time that they want to listen to your record. They’re gonna get out of it what they’re gonna get out of it, I suppose.\n\nThat’s really surprising, because that song, it’s a fantastic song, but that’s where the album is definitely a little darker and depressing, because you get really into the specifics of how down in the bender this guy is.\n\nPretty serious debasement happening.\n\nYeah, the whole cigarette butts lining his throat, that’s not exactly a beautiful image, I mean it’s a great image but it’s not…\n\nThat was funny, my sister was telling me the other day that she and my mother were listening to that song and that line came up and my mom was like, Do you think he really does that?\n\n(Laughs) I imagine they’ve had pretty opinionated reactions to the line where you’re like, Sorry Dad, no, I’m not making this up.\n\nYeah. Got to keep it real, whatever the cost. But, you know, I guess the flip-side of that is that, as with any sort of art, my intentions are, if they are followed to the letter, that is not necessarily the most productive interpretation for an individual listener. So I hope that on the flip-side of people getting the wrong idea, that they get something out of it that’s positive even if that’s not what I had in mind. Like, I got this really sweet Facebook message from this kid, some stranger, but he said that the album really encapsulated what it meant to be 18, and I was like s***, I thought I was trying to encapsulate what it meant to be 23. But you know, that guy was a slightly happier person for having this album that he thought was all about being 18 years old and that’s fine too, you know? At the end of the day, the purpose is just generating greater positivity, and whatever way that I can do that, so be it. I don’t think that getting wasted is the thing, but hopefully more positivity will come out of the record’s existence on this earth, rather than negativity. That’s always the idea, right, this record’s got to be utilitarian.\n\nOne part of the album that I kind of caught onto and that I’ve read you talking about a little bit is how you’re talking about antidepressants in that part that’s like, Robot inside of my head, that almost controlling force of this pill. You say at one point that you can’t do anything without its permission; do you really think that that sort of medication is kind of leading people to becoming sort of extra-human, like it’s something beyond natural life?\n\nOoh, interesting. Well, my opinion about my medicine has kind of changed since I wrote that song. I was really confused about the idea of the authenticity of emotions. But since then, I’ve kind of decided that, all that I know of the universe is my perceptions. Nothing’s good or bad, but thinking makes it so, as Hamlet says. So you know, I’m a 21st century man, and once more I exist at the center of my personal universe, I’m the master of my domain, as an existentialist I’m in control of my destiny. So I might as well tailor my emotions to being the most productive possible. But I guess it’s an ongoing something, because I do believe that we have to be unafraid to embrace the extremes of our human experience, whether that be the most exalted joys or the most horrific despairs. But it’s tough, sometimes it’s too scary. I don’t know man, it’s tough. Like Nietzsche says, humanity is something to be overcome, and I do believe that my medicine has made me a more productive person, a better person. Who’s to say that one way of pursuing that is better than another. For some people it’s taking SSRIs, for other people it’s booze, for other people it’s sexual conquest. Everything that we pursue in life is a means to a greater level of happiness for us, whatever that is. It’s all equally valid, they’re all inherently without any value, so might as well pick the one that works for me, I guess. But I guess there is still a little bit of shame instilled in me from not being able to do it all on my own. But I know that that’s just me, my programming, my having been brainwashed by a society that wants to keep people that suffer from any sort of mental illness at the bottom of the ladder, just like we try to do with anybody that’s different in any kind of noticeable way. I’m looking to deprogram myself about that.\n\nYou definitely seem to place a lot of emphasis on the process, whatever the process may be, of how people are trying to reach happiness or satisfaction.\n\nWell, you know, the authenticity of emotion—as an existentialist I believe that we, as individuals, decide what our authentic self is. Practically speaking, it’s probably ok, I’m probably going to keep taking them (laughs). Dude, it is a f****** awesome drug, it really did pretty much exactly what it said it was gonna do. How many products can you say that about these days?\n\nYou seem to identify pretty strongly as an existentialist then?\n\nYeah, I’ve mentioned that a few times, haven’t I? I guess it is pretty much my religion. I am striving to create my authentic self in the context of this crazy, absurd universe.\n\nSounds like a rational instinct to me.\n\nIt’s the best, because out of the hopelessness of our absurd universe comes absolute freedom, right? Because I exist in a universe that is enormous, that will squish me like the bug I am at some point sooner rather than later. But the other side of that coin is that I exist at the center of my own universe over which I exude total control as far as determining what my values are, what my definition of success is, and what it means for me to be a good person. And what greater currency can there be than that, in this crazy modern world? Or so it would appear to me, who f****** knows.\n\n</div>', 'Q&amp;A: Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '12-revision', '', '', '2010-09-21 02:41:42', '2010-09-21 02:41:42', '', 12, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=13', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

So that’s kind of the thing, everybody from New Jersey wants something better for themselves, because we’ve got a little bit of an inferiority complex too, everybody from New Jersey’s always singing about, oh, we’ve got to escape, we’ve got to be born to run, we’ve got to live on a prayer and all this, we’ve got to cast off the chains, the shackles of our regional identity, cause you know we all dream of bigger and better things than New Jersey can afford us. But I mean, it’s all nonsense, right? It’s like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it, right?\r\n\r\nIt’s lines on a map.\r\n\r\nYeah. But I will certainly say that, the New Jersey that’s being force-fed to America right now through our popular culture is most certainly not the New Jersey that I grew up in and not really the New Jersey that we sing about in our more hopeful moments.\r\n\r\nThat’s good to hear. It definitely seems to haunt slash hover over your music. I mean, “A More Perfect Union” has both “Looking for a new New Jersey” and “I never should have left New Jersey.” So it’s almost like this conflictedness about it.\r\n\r\nThey’re equally true, right? They’re equally valid and equally invalid. At that point in the story, our hero hasn’t really learned the value of internal validation, you know? Our hero casts about for sources of peace and fulfillment from the outside world. What a f****** mistake.\r\n\r\nDoes our hero learn the value of internal validation by the end of the album, do you think?\r\n\r\nWell, sort of, it’s implicit. The road that lays ahead of our hero remains long and arduous, but our hero has learned a little something about personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the environment that our hero is passing through on this album, the war imagery is there from the title, it’s there in the song titles, it’s all over the place. What is it about battle and the idea of war that resonates so much with you, why is it so symbolic? The metaphor seems to extend to mental health, to relationships, it’s all over the place.\r\n\r\nTo be a human, to live amongst other humans is to be constantly in conflict, we never are able to f****** get along. Sometimes it ends up with us killing each other in enormous numbers, other times we just turn up our noses at each other. It’s a story that’s as old as human interaction. Even though we have the same wants and needs more or less, we always find some way to pit ourselves against another. The classic self-other relationship, that kind of way that we view the world, the way that we put ourselves in opposition to some kind of real or imagined oppressor, you know? The human inability to define oneself positively, right? To look inward for our validation and our values and our definitions of success, right? Every human has the power, the right and the responsibility to determine those things for ourselves, but for a lot of us that is too heavy a responsibility and it’s easier to look outward and say, if not for so and so, if not for this guy or that guy I’d be happy as a clam. But as it is, I’m stranded here amongst all the little people and I’m f****** miserable. It follows that the answer to eliminating that misery is eliminating the other human, or if not eliminating him, taking away his or her freedoms so we can have more freedoms to ourselves, which is of course all a lot of hogwash. It consistently does more harm than good, as evidence by the untold thousands of Americans that fill the battlefields of our horrific civil war, 150 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt’s that idea that life’s a zero-sum game, where if one guy’s got something then you can’t have that something because he’s already got it and it all has to balance out.\r\n\r\nYeah, it’s crazy. Freedoms are renewable resources, and it’s kind of a self-generating thing, the more of it that gets spread around— I don’t know man, us humans are f***** up.\r\n\r\nIt’s a complicated issue, that’s for sure.\r\n\r\nYeah, definitely. Probably the most complicated issue that yet has existed: how to get we humans to get along. The person who figures out is going to be a wealthy man. Or woman. Or transgender.\r\n\r\nLeave all the options open.\r\n\r\nCould be anybody.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. So, you guys, in your music, your lyrics especially, there’s artistic references all over the place, and it’s both high art and quote-unqoute low art, which doesn’t really exist. But, you know, Fortress of Solitude, Brueghel, Camus, Whitman.  What are you like as a consumer of art: do you read a lot, what are you interested in?\r\n\r\nOh, you know, pretty much everything, right? This world is so full of ideas. A really bad way to get smarter is to draw arbitrary lines across our culture, to say that one piece of information is more valuable than another. The people that are going to define where our culture goes are going to be the ones that are best able to straddle that completely made-up line between high and low culture. Because from either side of that line there’s countless wondrous things to learn, and things that can enhance our earthly experience. To cut yourself off from any of them is doing yourself a great disservice. We’re the most blessed generation of humans that’s every lived, as far as our access to information and stuff. We should be the smartest humans of all time. And we probably can be if we decide that we want to. Wouldn’t you say, Kev?\r\n\r\nI couldn’t agree more. You do a little bit of that involvement with all of these spoken-word passages on the album and the quoting, it informs the album really well I think. It’s cool that you had those guests read those parts. What made you want to get guys like Craig Finn involved, other than the fact that Craig Finn is just a really great dude—what made you want to pull in all these other guys to read these parts and not just read them yourself, or have someone else in the band read them?\r\n\r\nWell, it’s kind of a more the merrier thing. I’m very blessed to have accumulated, as my friends, probably the most talented people in the world, and I would be remiss if I didn’t make the best possible use of their multitudes of talents for my own selfish purposes. It’s like I said, the more the merrier. Friendly, neighborly thing, trying to foster that inclusive environment, the communal element that’s so vital to punk. Even though there’s only five people in the band right now, we’re not trying to have some kind of inclusive club.\r\n\r\nYeah, there’s a great community aspect to Titus Andronicus, you guys are really inclusive it seems like.\r\n\r\nThat’s what it’s all about, you know? Too much of our f****** modern world is so exclusive. Everybody gets a hard-on when they can have something that they can keep hidden away from somebody else. What a f****** dumbass thing to do. Community, inclusiveness is the opposite of that, and that’s pretty much what we’re interested in.\r\n\r\nYou seem like a very genuine guy. You don’t seem to spend a lot of time saying things that you don’t truly believe.\r\n\r\nNo, what the f*** would be the point of that, that would be the dumbest thing I could do. I only have so much time on this Earth, I don’t have any time to speak falsities, you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nYeah, I appreciate that. How important—because it took me a really long to figure out a good idea of how The Monitor’s concept went from beginning to end—how important do you think it is for listeners to know that story, to know that there is a hero and these things are happening to him?\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, that’s not really for me to say. We put it out into the world—our part of the interpretation process is pretty much over. I can talk to you now and say what I meant and hopefully you can tell the kids about it, but for the most part, when you put something out into the world you kind of have to let go of your control over it, people are going to take it and do with it what they will, you know? Sometimes people seem to really get the idea and sometimes people communicate to me by their words and actions that they have no idea what we’re talking about, or completely don’t give a s*** about it. I don’t know man, look at Fugazi, Fugazi couldn’t possibly have been more to the point, and for their whole career they had to fight against people having totally the hundred-percent wrong idea about what they were doing. So like, f***, if Fugazi couldn’t pull it off, what chance do we have? Probably close to zero. I hate to be misunderstood, but that’s kind of, if you want to be a human and interact with another human that’s pretty much inevitable, right?\r\n\r\nI know exactly what you’re talking about, because I’ve read a lot about the album that gets really hung up on the idea of it being this depressing, dark, kind of relentless piece. I personally have always thought the album was really beautiful and quite uplifting, especially by the end: there’s some definite optimism there. I think people hear a certain tone and they don’t look past it.\r\n\r\nThere have been huge misconstruings. Like our song, “Theme from Cheers,” for example, the seventh song on that record, that was supposed to be our hero’s most pitiful moment, but now it seems like, people have got the idea that it’s about how getting wasted’s awesome, and that wasn’t the idea at all. But that’s kind of like, what the f*** are you gonna do, right? You can’t hold peoples’ hands every time that they want to listen to your record. They’re gonna get out of it what they’re gonna get out of it, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThat’s really surprising, because that song, it’s a fantastic song, but that’s where the album is definitely a little darker and depressing, because you get really into the specifics of how down in the bender this guy is.\r\n\r\nPretty serious debasement happening.\r\n\r\nYeah, the whole cigarette butts lining his throat, that’s not exactly a beautiful image, I mean it’s a great image but it’s not…\r\n\r\nThat was funny, my sister was telling me the other day that she and my mother were listening to that song and that line came up and my mom was like, Do you think he really does that?\r\n\r\n(Laughs) I imagine they’ve had pretty opinionated reactions to the line where you’re like, Sorry Dad, no, I’m not making this up.\r\n\r\nYeah. Got to keep it real, whatever the cost. But, you know, I guess the flip-side of that is that, as with any sort of art, my intentions are, if they are followed to the letter, that is not necessarily the most productive interpretation for an individual listener. So I hope that on the flip-side of people getting the wrong idea, that they get something out of it that’s positive even if that’s not what I had in mind. Like, I got this really sweet Facebook message from this kid, some stranger, but he said that the album really encapsulated what it meant to be 18, and I was like s***, I thought I was trying to encapsulate what it meant to be 23. But you know, that guy was a slightly happier person for having this album that he thought was all about being 18 years old and that’s fine too, you know? At the end of the day, the purpose is just generating greater positivity, and whatever way that I can do that, so be it. I don’t think that getting wasted is the thing, but hopefully more positivity will come out of the record’s existence on this earth, rather than negativity. That’s always the idea, right, this record’s got to be utilitarian.\r\n\r\nOne part of the album that I kind of caught onto and that I’ve read you talking about a little bit is how you’re talking about antidepressants in that part that’s like, Robot inside of my head, that almost controlling force of this pill. You say at one point that you can’t do anything without its permission; do you really think that that sort of medication is kind of leading people to becoming sort of extra-human, like it’s something beyond natural life?\r\n\r\nOoh, interesting. Well, my opinion about my medicine has kind of changed since I wrote that song. I was really confused about the idea of the authenticity of emotions. But since then, I’ve kind of decided that, all that I know of the universe is my perceptions. Nothing’s good or bad, but thinking makes it so, as Hamlet says. So you know, I’m a 21st century man, and once more I exist at the center of my personal universe, I’m the master of my domain, as an existentialist I’m in control of my destiny. So I might as well tailor my emotions to being the most productive possible. But I guess it’s an ongoing something, because I do believe that we have to be unafraid to embrace the extremes of our human experience, whether that be the most exalted joys or the most horrific despairs. But it’s tough, sometimes it’s too scary. I don’t know man, it’s tough. Like Nietzsche says, humanity is something to be overcome, and I do believe that my medicine has made me a more productive person, a better person. Who’s to say that one way of pursuing that is better than another. For some people it’s taking SSRIs, for other people it’s booze, for other people it’s sexual conquest. Everything that we pursue in life is a means to a greater level of happiness for us, whatever that is. It’s all equally valid, they’re all inherently without any value, so might as well pick the one that works for me, I guess. But I guess there is still a little bit of shame instilled in me from not being able to do it all on my own. But I know that that’s just me, my programming, my having been brainwashed by a society that wants to keep people that suffer from any sort of mental illness at the bottom of the ladder, just like we try to do with anybody that’s different in any kind of noticeable way. I’m looking to deprogram myself about that.\r\n\r\nYou definitely seem to place a lot of emphasis on the process, whatever the process may be, of how people are trying to reach happiness or satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWell, you know, the authenticity of emotion—as an existentialist I believe that we, as individuals, decide what our authentic self is. Practically speaking, it’s probably ok, I’m probably going to keep taking them (laughs). Dude, it is a f****** awesome drug, it really did pretty much exactly what it said it was gonna do. How many products can you say that about these days?\r\n\r\nYou seem to identify pretty strongly as an existentialist then?\r\n\r\nYeah, I’ve mentioned that a few times, haven’t I? I guess it is pretty much my religion. I am striving to create my authentic self in the context of this crazy, absurd universe.\r\n\r\nSounds like a rational instinct to me.\r\n\r\nIt’s the best, because out of the hopelessness of our absurd universe comes absolute freedom, right? Because I exist in a universe that is enormous, that will squish me like the bug I am at some point sooner rather than later. But the other side of that coin is that I exist at the center of my own universe over which I exude total control as far as determining what my values are, what my definition of success is, and what it means for me to be a good person. And what greater currency can there be than that, in this crazy modern world? Or so it would appear to me, who f****** knows.\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Q&amp;A: Patrick Stickles of Titus Andronicus', 'Titus Andronicus will be hitting the Duke Coffeehouse Tuesday Sept. 21, (doors at 8:30 p.m., show at 9:00 p.m., tickets $10 and free with Duke I.D.), touring behind the best album of 2010—their epic The Monitor.

Because, they are leading the biggest study ever of the rare disease called Selective Eating Disorder, of which I am one of 1,400 known sufferers.\n\nWhat is the disease? I don’t know anything about it.\n\nMost people don’t know anything about it. Very little is known about it, but Duke is leading the way in research on it. Basically, Selective Eating Disorder is exactly what it sounds like: people who suffer from it are extremely selective about the foods they eat. Me, for example, I’m only able to eat about 20 different foods. It’s a compulsion of some kind, it’s kind of like, one of the theories is that it could be related to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. And I’ve only just found out that it existed recently, I’ve lived with it for my whole life—me and my family have lived with it for my whole life—and I just thought that I was the weirdest dude in the world, but it turns out that there are at least 1,400 of us that exist. And I’m really pumped that Duke is leading the way trying to get more knowledge about it, maybe we can, hopefully someday soon there’ll be some sort of effective treatment. Because, it is crazy, it’s one of the craziest diseases. It’s quite the mystery, and I feel good knowing that such a fine university as Duke has got their team working on unraveling it, I can’t wait to see what they come up with it.\n\nFirst thing I wanted to ask you: how did you end up in this Ted Leo video that just came out, the “Bottled in Cork” video?\n\nWell, Ted and I, we know each other a little bit, having gone on tour together and stuff, so we’d been texting, trying to schedule some kind of, like, hanging-out time, because he’s usually sometimes the guy I go to for fatherly advice about punk stuff. We ended up not ever having this meeting but, in the course of our texting, he revealed that he was going to be in New York and was going to do this music video in Brooklyn where I happen to live. So you know, he just said, come by at four o clock, we’re doing this video, and pretty much the rest is history.\n\nIt was really funny, it came out really well.\n\nYeah, that video’s pretty awesome.\n\nYeah, so I’ll ask you some more substantial questions now, but I was curious about that. So, first off. The Monitor is distinguished, basically, to me by the fact that there are almost no repeated lyrics on the album. You guys don’t really do choruses, you don’t really do traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. There are the chants, like “The enemy is everywhere,” “You’ll always be a loser,” that sort of stuff, but the feel is very literary, very poetic. I was curious how you got into that sort of writing style, why you decided to write in that sort of longer, sequential way, instead of doing the verse-chorus-verse thing.\n\nWell, I guess it all began with the band Neutral Milk Hotel. You know, their work, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, one of my very favorites, probably the greatest album ever. And that record didn’t have any repeated refrains on it, I observed one day. I hadn’t been too interested in that sort of stuff before, anyway, but upon noticing that they didn’t do it at all, I felt pretty firm in my resolve that choruses are probably pretty unnecessary for the most part, you know? If you say something once, why say it again. I just don’t find it the most effective means to communicate my ideas. Furthermore, if you don’t do it all the time, hopefully the result will be that when you do do it, the device will be a little more potent, if you don’t overdo it. If you don’t repeat too much stuff, hopefully when you do repeat something, people will get the idea that maybe this is kind of a takeaway point. So, if we’re gonna repeat something, it’s gotta be a point that we really gotta hammer home, rather than just having something that’s easy to remember and sing along to, although that is important. There’s a lot to say, there’s a lot that we’re trying to communicate, and we can’t really afford to give up that much lyrical real-estate.\n\nIt’s funny, because I got to interview Dan McGee—\n\nOh my God, the greatest living genius of American song!\n\n(Laughs) Dude is good, I remember when I saw you guys play at Local 506 with Spider Bags, I remember you opened up with, We’re happy to be here with Spider Bags, the greatest band in the world. But I asked him about coming up and doing the verse on “Theme from Cheers,” and he said, Yeah, Patrick’s got a lot to say (laughs).\n\nIt’s a wide and wondrous world of ideas, you know? But little do I have to say than Spider Bags being the greatest band in the world. Which I say again now, and I’m being as unfacetious as I was then. Again, I remain steadfast.\n\nYou knew Dan when he was in DC Snipers, right, well before Spider Bags?\n\nYes sir, although I didn’t know him as well as I do now. I met him a few times when he was playing the DC Snipers, that’s true, that was my introduction to him. Me and my friend Sarem, who plays in a band called Liquor Store, happened to go see the DC Snipers open for the Black Lips at this little place in New York called Siberia, and it was pretty much love at first sight, especially since they were all from New Jersey, and we were young New Jersey punk rockers at the time in need of some role models—probably couldn’t have picked five worse ones than the DC Snipers but that’s ok.\n\nWhat do you think it is about New Jersey that has this presence in so much music, and so much—it goes beyond music too, because you’ve got Philip Roth with the Newark trope and it’s, Jersey’s everywhere. What is it about that state that is so resonant with artists?\n\nWell, New Jersey does have a really strong literary tradition. Don’t forget Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, too, though I guess those guys are long dead. It’s the underdog, the longshot, the dude that everybody’s already counted out, you know?. People in New Jersey, we get s*** on all the time from all sides, everybody thinks we’re the armpit of America, that we stink. They drive on the New Jersey Turnpike and they smell the Meadowlands and they think that New Jersey is just the s***hole. Or they see us on TV, in our wifebeaters with our gold chains and our pink tans and our blowouts and they think they know everything about us, and New Jersey’s just a big f****** cesspool, and it’s just where America dumps off its garbage. So everybody pretty much thinks they’ve got New Jersey figured out. And nobody likes that, nobody wants to get put in a box, nobody wants to have somebody’s opinion of them decided before they know anything about them. So that’s kind of the thing, everybody from New Jersey wants something better for themselves, because we’ve got a little bit of an inferiority complex too, everybody from New Jersey’s always singing about, oh, we’ve got to escape, we’ve got to be born to run, we’ve got to live on a prayer and all this, we’ve got to cast off the chains, the shackles of our regional identity, cause you know we all dream of bigger and better things than New Jersey can afford us. But I mean, it’s all nonsense, right? It’s like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it, right?\n\nIt’s lines on a map.\n\nYeah. But I will certainly say that, the New Jersey that’s being force-fed to America right now through our popular culture is most certainly not the New Jersey that I grew up in and not really the New Jersey that we sing about in our more hopeful moments.\n\nThat’s good to hear. It definitely seems to haunt slash hover over your music. I mean, “A More Perfect Union” has both “Looking for a new New Jersey” and “I never should have left New Jersey.” So it’s almost like this conflictedness about it.\n\nThey’re equally true, right? They’re equally valid and equally invalid. At that point in the story, our hero hasn’t really learned the value of internal validation, you know? Our hero casts about for sources of peace and fulfillment from the outside world. What a f****** mistake.\n\nDoes our hero learn the value of internal validation by the end of the album, do you think?\n\nWell, sort of, it’s implicit. The road that lays ahead of our hero remains long and arduous, but our hero has learned a little something about personal responsibility.\n\nSpeaking of the environment that our hero is passing through on this album, the war imagery is there from the title, it’s there in the song titles, it’s all over the place. What is it about battle and the idea of war that resonates so much with you, why is it so symbolic? The metaphor seems to extend to mental health, to relationships, it’s all over the place.\n\nTo be a human, to live amongst other humans is to be constantly in conflict, we never are able to f****** get along. Sometimes it ends up with us killing each other in enormous numbers, other times we just turn up our noses at each other. It’s a story that’s as old as human interaction.

It consistently does more harm than good, as evidence by the untold thousands of Americans that fill the battlefields of our horrific civil war, 150 years ago.\n\nIt’s that idea that life’s a zero-sum game, where if one guy’s got something then you can’t have that something because he’s already got it and it all has to balance out.\n\nYeah, it’s crazy. Freedoms are renewable resources, and it’s kind of a self-generating thing, the more of it that gets spread around— I don’t know man, us humans are f***** up.\n\nIt’s a complicated issue, that’s for sure.\n\nYeah, definitely. Probably the most complicated issue that yet has existed: how to get we humans to get along. The person who figures out is going to be a wealthy man. Or woman.

I don’t know man, look at Fugazi, Fugazi couldn’t possibly have been more to the point, and for their whole career they had to fight against people having totally the hundred-percent wrong idea about what they were doing. So like, f***, if Fugazi couldn’t pull it off, what chance do we have? Probably close to zero. I hate to be misunderstood, but that’s kind of, if you want to be a human and interact with another human that’s pretty much inevitable, right?\n\nI know exactly what you’re talking about, because I’ve read a lot about the album that gets really hung up on the idea of it being this depressing, dark, kind of relentless piece. I personally have always thought the album was really beautiful and quite uplifting, especially by the end: there’s some definite optimism there. I think people hear a certain tone and they don’t look past it.\n\nThere have been huge misconstruings. Like our song, “Theme from Cheers,” for example, the seventh song on that record, that was supposed to be our hero’s most pitiful moment, but now it seems like, people have got the idea that it’s about how getting wasted’s awesome, and that wasn’t the idea at all. But that’s kind of like, what the f*** are you gonna do, right? You can’t hold peoples’ hands every time that they want to listen to your record. They’re gonna get out of it what they’re gonna get out of it, I suppose.\n\nThat’s really surprising, because that song, it’s a fantastic song, but that’s where the album is definitely a little darker and depressing, because you get really into the specifics of how down in the bender this guy is.\n\nPretty serious debasement happening.\n\nYeah, the whole cigarette butts lining his throat, that’s not exactly a beautiful image, I mean it’s a great image but it’s not…\n\nThat was funny, my sister was telling me the other day that she and my mother were listening to that song and that line came up and my mom was like, Do you think he really does that?\n\n(Laughs) I imagine they’ve had pretty opinionated reactions to the line where you’re like, Sorry Dad, no, I’m not making this up.\n\nYeah. Got to keep it real, whatever the cost. But, you know, I guess the flip-side of that is that, as with any sort of art, my intentions are, if they are followed to the letter, that is not necessarily the most productive interpretation for an individual listener. So I hope that on the flip-side of people getting the wrong idea, that they get something out of it that’s positive even if that’s not what I had in mind. Like, I got this really sweet Facebook message from this kid, some stranger, but he said that the album really encapsulated what it meant to be 18, and I was like s***, I thought I was trying to encapsulate what it meant to be 23. But you know, that guy was a slightly happier person for having this album that he thought was all about being 18 years old and that’s fine too, you know? At the end of the day, the purpose is just generating greater positivity, and whatever way that I can do that, so be it. I don’t think that getting wasted is the thing, but hopefully more positivity will come out of the record’s existence on this earth, rather than negativity. That’s always the idea, right, this record’s got to be utilitarian.\n\nOne part of the album that I kind of caught onto and that I’ve read you talking about a little bit is how you’re talking about antidepressants in that part that’s like, Robot inside of my head, that almost controlling force of this pill. You say at one point that you can’t do anything without its permission; do you really think that that sort of medication is kind of leading people to becoming sort of extra-human, like it’s something beyond natural life?\n\nOoh, interesting. Well, my opinion about my medicine has kind of changed since I wrote that song. I was really confused about the idea of the authenticity of emotions. But since then, I’ve kind of decided that, all that I know of the universe is my perceptions. Nothing’s good or bad, but thinking makes it so, as Hamlet says. So you know, I’m a 21st century man, and once more I exist at the center of my personal universe, I’m the master of my domain, as an existentialist I’m in control of my destiny. So I might as well tailor my emotions to being the most productive possible. But I guess it’s an ongoing something, because I do believe that we have to be unafraid to embrace the extremes of our human experience, whether that be the most exalted joys or the most horrific despairs. But it’s tough, sometimes it’s too scary. I don’t know man, it’s tough. Like Nietzsche says, humanity is something to be overcome, and I do believe that my medicine has made me a more productive person, a better person. Who’s to say that one way of pursuing that is better than another. For some people it’s taking SSRIs, for other people it’s booze, for other people it’s sexual conquest. Everything that we pursue in life is a means to a greater level of happiness for us, whatever that is. It’s all equally valid, they’re all inherently without any value, so might as well pick the one that works for me, I guess. But I guess there is still a little bit of shame instilled in me from not being able to do it all on my own. But I know that that’s just me, my programming, my having been brainwashed by a society that wants to keep people that suffer from any sort of mental illness at the bottom of the ladder, just like we try to do with anybody that’s different in any kind of noticeable way. I’m looking to deprogram myself about that.\n\nYou definitely seem to place a lot of emphasis on the process, whatever the process may be, of how people are trying to reach happiness or satisfaction.\n\nWell, you know, the authenticity of emotion—as an existentialist I believe that we, as individuals, decide what our authentic self is. Practically speaking, it’s probably ok, I’m probably going to keep taking them (laughs). Dude, it is a f****** awesome drug, it really did pretty much exactly what it said it was gonna do. How many products can you say that about these days?\n\nYou seem to identify pretty strongly as an existentialist then?\n\nYeah, I’ve mentioned that a few times, haven’t I? I guess it is pretty much my religion. I am striving to create my authentic self in the context of this crazy, absurd universe.\n\nSounds like a rational instinct to me.\n\nIt’s the best, because out of the hopelessness of our absurd universe comes absolute freedom, right? Because I exist in a universe that is enormous, that will squish me like the bug I am at some point sooner rather than later. But the other side of that coin is that I exist at the center of my own universe over which I exude total control as far as determining what my values are, what my definition of success is, and what it means for me to be a good person. And what greater currency can there be than that, in this crazy modern world?

Because, they are leading the biggest study ever of the rare disease called Selective Eating Disorder, of which I am one of 1,400 known sufferers.\r\n\r\nWhat is the disease? I don’t know anything about it.\r\n\r\nMost people don’t know anything about it. Very little is known about it, but Duke is leading the way in research on it. Basically, Selective Eating Disorder is exactly what it sounds like: people who suffer from it are extremely selective about the foods they eat. Me, for example, I’m only able to eat about 20 different foods. It’s a compulsion of some kind, it’s kind of like, one of the theories is that it could be related to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. And I’ve only just found out that it existed recently, I’ve lived with it for my whole life—me and my family have lived with it for my whole life—and I just thought that I was the weirdest dude in the world, but it turns out that there are at least 1,400 of us that exist. And I’m really pumped that Duke is leading the way trying to get more knowledge about it, maybe we can, hopefully someday soon there’ll be some sort of effective treatment. Because, it is crazy, it’s one of the craziest diseases. It’s quite the mystery, and I feel good knowing that such a fine university as Duke has got their team working on unraveling it, I can’t wait to see what they come up with it.\r\n\r\nFirst thing I wanted to ask you: how did you end up in this Ted Leo video that just came out, the “Bottled in Cork” video?\r\n\r\nWell, Ted and I, we know each other a little bit, having gone on tour together and stuff, so we’d been texting, trying to schedule some kind of, like, hanging-out time, because he’s usually sometimes the guy I go to for fatherly advice about punk stuff. We ended up not ever having this meeting but, in the course of our texting, he revealed that he was going to be in New York and was going to do this music video in Brooklyn where I happen to live. So you know, he just said, come by at four o clock, we’re doing this video, and pretty much the rest is history.\r\n\r\nIt was really funny, it came out really well.\r\n\r\nYeah, that video’s pretty awesome.\r\n\r\nYeah, so I’ll ask you some more substantial questions now, but I was curious about that. So, first off. The Monitor is distinguished, basically, to me by the fact that there are almost no repeated lyrics on the album. You guys don’t really do choruses, you don’t really do traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. There are the chants, like “The enemy is everywhere,” “You’ll always be a loser,” that sort of stuff, but the feel is very literary, very poetic. I was curious how you got into that sort of writing style, why you decided to write in that sort of longer, sequential way, instead of doing the verse-chorus-verse thing.\r\n\r\nWell, I guess it all began with the band Neutral Milk Hotel. You know, their work, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, one of my very favorites, probably the greatest album ever. And that record didn’t have any repeated refrains on it, I observed one day. I hadn’t been too interested in that sort of stuff before, anyway, but upon noticing that they didn’t do it at all, I felt pretty firm in my resolve that choruses are probably pretty unnecessary for the most part, you know? If you say something once, why say it again. I just don’t find it the most effective means to communicate my ideas. Furthermore, if you don’t do it all the time, hopefully the result will be that when you do do it, the device will be a little more potent, if you don’t overdo it. If you don’t repeat too much stuff, hopefully when you do repeat something, people will get the idea that maybe this is kind of a takeaway point. So, if we’re gonna repeat something, it’s gotta be a point that we really gotta hammer home, rather than just having something that’s easy to remember and sing along to, although that is important. There’s a lot to say, there’s a lot that we’re trying to communicate, and we can’t really afford to give up that much lyrical real-estate.\r\n\r\nIt’s funny, because I got to interview Dan McGee—\r\n\r\nOh my God, the greatest living genius of American song!\r\n\r\n(Laughs) Dude is good, I remember when I saw you guys play at Local 506 with Spider Bags, I remember you opened up with, We’re happy to be here with Spider Bags, the greatest band in the world. But I asked him about coming up and doing the verse on “Theme from Cheers,” and he said, Yeah, Patrick’s got a lot to say (laughs).\r\n\r\nIt’s a wide and wondrous world of ideas, you know? But little do I have to say than Spider Bags being the greatest band in the world. Which I say again now, and I’m being as unfacetious as I was then. Again, I remain steadfast.\r\n\r\nYou knew Dan when he was in DC Snipers, right, well before Spider Bags?\r\n\r\nYes sir, although I didn’t know him as well as I do now. I met him a few times when he was playing the DC Snipers, that’s true, that was my introduction to him. Me and my friend Sarem, who plays in a band called Liquor Store, happened to go see the DC Snipers open for the Black Lips at this little place in New York called Siberia, and it was pretty much love at first sight, especially since they were all from New Jersey, and we were young New Jersey punk rockers at the time in need of some role models—probably couldn’t have picked five worse ones than the DC Snipers but that’s ok.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think it is about New Jersey that has this presence in so much music, and so much—it goes beyond music too, because you’ve got Philip Roth with the Newark trope and it’s, Jersey’s everywhere. What is it about that state that is so resonant with artists?\r\n\r\nWell, New Jersey does have a really strong literary tradition. Don’t forget Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, too, though I guess those guys are long dead. It’s the underdog, the longshot, the dude that everybody’s already counted out, you know?. People in New Jersey, we get s*** on all the time from all sides, everybody thinks we’re the armpit of America, that we stink. They drive on the New Jersey Turnpike and they smell the Meadowlands and they think that New Jersey is just the s***hole. Or they see us on TV, in our wifebeaters with our gold chains and our pink tans and our blowouts and they think they know everything about us, and New Jersey’s just a big f****** cesspool, and it’s just where America dumps off its garbage. So everybody pretty much thinks they’ve got New Jersey figured out. And nobody likes that, nobody wants to get put in a box, nobody wants to have somebody’s opinion of them decided before they know anything about them. So that’s kind of the thing, everybody from New Jersey wants something better for themselves, because we’ve got a little bit of an inferiority complex too, everybody from New Jersey’s always singing about, oh, we’ve got to escape, we’ve got to be born to run, we’ve got to live on a prayer and all this, we’ve got to cast off the chains, the shackles of our regional identity, cause you know we all dream of bigger and better things than New Jersey can afford us. But I mean, it’s all nonsense, right? It’s like anything else, you get out of it what you put into it, right?\r\n\r\nIt’s lines on a map.\r\n\r\nYeah. But I will certainly say that, the New Jersey that’s being force-fed to America right now through our popular culture is most certainly not the New Jersey that I grew up in and not really the New Jersey that we sing about in our more hopeful moments.\r\n\r\nThat’s good to hear. It definitely seems to haunt slash hover over your music. I mean, “A More Perfect Union” has both “Looking for a new New Jersey” and “I never should have left New Jersey.” So it’s almost like this conflictedness about it.\r\n\r\nThey’re equally true, right? They’re equally valid and equally invalid. At that point in the story, our hero hasn’t really learned the value of internal validation, you know? Our hero casts about for sources of peace and fulfillment from the outside world. What a f****** mistake.\r\n\r\nDoes our hero learn the value of internal validation by the end of the album, do you think?\r\n\r\nWell, sort of, it’s implicit. The road that lays ahead of our hero remains long and arduous, but our hero has learned a little something about personal responsibility.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the environment that our hero is passing through on this album, the war imagery is there from the title, it’s there in the song titles, it’s all over the place. What is it about battle and the idea of war that resonates so much with you, why is it so symbolic? The metaphor seems to extend to mental health, to relationships, it’s all over the place.\r\n\r\nTo be a human, to live amongst other humans is to be constantly in conflict, we never are able to f****** get along. Sometimes it ends up with us killing each other in enormous numbers, other times we just turn up our noses at each other. It’s a story that’s as old as human interaction. Even though we have the same wants and needs more or less, we always find some way to pit ourselves against another. The classic self-other relationship, that kind of way that we view the world, the way that we put ourselves in opposition to some kind of real or imagined oppressor, you know? The human inability to define oneself positively, right? To look inward for our validation and our values and our definitions of success, right? Every human has the power, the right and the responsibility to determine those things for ourselves, but for a lot of us that is too heavy a responsibility and it’s easier to look outward and say, if not for so and so, if not for this guy or that guy I’d be happy as a clam. But as it is, I’m stranded here amongst all the little people and I’m f****** miserable. It follows that the answer to eliminating that misery is eliminating the other human, or if not eliminating him, taking away his or her freedoms so we can have more freedoms to ourselves, which is of course all a lot of hogwash. It consistently does more harm than good, as evidence by the untold thousands of Americans that fill the battlefields of our horrific civil war, 150 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt’s that idea that life’s a zero-sum game, where if one guy’s got something then you can’t have that something because he’s already got it and it all has to balance out.\r\n\r\nYeah, it’s crazy. Freedoms are renewable resources, and it’s kind of a self-generating thing, the more of it that gets spread around— I don’t know man, us humans are f***** up.\r\n\r\nIt’s a complicated issue, that’s for sure.\r\n\r\nYeah, definitely. Probably the most complicated issue that yet has existed: how to get we humans to get along. The person who figures out is going to be a wealthy man. Or woman. Or transgender.\r\n\r\nLeave all the options open.\r\n\r\nCould be anybody.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. So, you guys, in your music, your lyrics especially, there’s artistic references all over the place, and it’s both high art and quote-unqoute low art, which doesn’t really exist. But, you know, Fortress of Solitude, Brueghel, Camus, Whitman.  What are you like as a consumer of art: do you read a lot, what are you interested in?\r\n\r\nOh, you know, pretty much everything, right? This world is so full of ideas. A really bad way to get smarter is to draw arbitrary lines across our culture, to say that one piece of information is more valuable than another. The people that are going to define where our culture goes are going to be the ones that are best able to straddle that completely made-up line between high and low culture. Because from either side of that line there’s countless wondrous things to learn, and things that can enhance our earthly experience. To cut yourself off from any of them is doing yourself a great disservice. We’re the most blessed generation of humans that’s every lived, as far as our access to information and stuff. We should be the smartest humans of all time. And we probably can be if we decide that we want to. Wouldn’t you say, Kev?\r\n\r\nI couldn’t agree more. You do a little bit of that involvement with all of these spoken-word passages on the album and the quoting, it informs the album really well I think. It’s cool that you had those guests read those parts. What made you want to get guys like Craig Finn involved, other than the fact that Craig Finn is just a really great dude—what made you want to pull in all these other guys to read these parts and not just read them yourself, or have someone else in the band read them?\r\n\r\nWell, it’s kind of a more the merrier thing. I’m very blessed to have accumulated, as my friends, probably the most talented people in the world, and I would be remiss if I didn’t make the best possible use of their multitudes of talents for my own selfish purposes. It’s like I said, the more the merrier. Friendly, neighborly thing, trying to foster that inclusive environment, the communal element that’s so vital to punk. Even though there’s only five people in the band right now, we’re not trying to have some kind of inclusive club.\r\n\r\nYeah, there’s a great community aspect to Titus Andronicus, you guys are really inclusive it seems like.\r\n\r\nThat’s what it’s all about, you know? Too much of our f****** modern world is so exclusive. Everybody gets a hard-on when they can have something that they can keep hidden away from somebody else. What a f****** dumbass thing to do. Community, inclusiveness is the opposite of that, and that’s pretty much what we’re interested in.\r\n\r\nYou seem like a very genuine guy. You don’t seem to spend a lot of time saying things that you don’t truly believe.\r\n\r\nNo, what the f*** would be the point of that, that would be the dumbest thing I could do. I only have so much time on this Earth, I don’t have any time to speak falsities, you know what I mean?\r\n\r\nYeah, I appreciate that. How important—because it took me a really long to figure out a good idea of how The Monitor’s concept went from beginning to end—how important do you think it is for listeners to know that story, to know that there is a hero and these things are happening to him?\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, that’s not really for me to say. We put it out into the world—our part of the interpretation process is pretty much over. I can talk to you now and say what I meant and hopefully you can tell the kids about it, but for the most part, when you put something out into the world you kind of have to let go of your control over it, people are going to take it and do with it what they will, you know? Sometimes people seem to really get the idea and sometimes people communicate to me by their words and actions that they have no idea what we’re talking about, or completely don’t give a s*** about it. I don’t know man, look at Fugazi, Fugazi couldn’t possibly have been more to the point, and for their whole career they had to fight against people having totally the hundred-percent wrong idea about what they were doing. So like, f***, if Fugazi couldn’t pull it off, what chance do we have? Probably close to zero.

To me music means exactly that, people who play instruments.  We play instruments that have rich traditions, but we try to be unique voices on the instruments; that’s what music is for me.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Though you weren’t a member of the group when <em>Punch</em> [the band’s first record] was recorded, you’ve toured extensively for that album.  Do you feel that the band’s sound has changed or evolved?</strong>\r\n\r\nCertainly.  <em>Punch</em> contains a 42-minute, four-movement suite, “The Blind Leaving the Blind”, which is Thile’s composition.  <em>Antifogmatic</em> is a collection of shorter songs that are collaboratively written.  That’s a pretty major difference right there.  The nature of collaborative writing led to a more direct musical product: shorter songs, less of the long-form harmonic movements that writing solo can allow for. That’s the reason for the difference between the two records, the collaboration.\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve been known to play both album cuts and personal favorites, such as Strokes and Radiohead covers and classical pieces, in your live shows.  What’s in store for your show at Cat’s Cradle?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe really mix it up and we do try to cater to the particular venue and audience, since we play such a span of places.  We play everything from bars to larger concert halls where everyone’s seated; it’s a pretty big span.  Cat’s Cradle, I’ve never been there, but we’re probably going to rock a little bit more than usual.  I don’t think any Bach is in store for the show but you never know.  We’ll certainly be playing a lot of songs from the new record and the hits from old one.\r\n\r\n<strong>This is the fanboy in me talking, but what’s it like working with Chris Thile [of Nickel Creek fame]?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s been great.  I’ve been in the band for two years, and I’m the only member who is not original.  The whole band is astounding, every individual in the group.  I’ve learned a lot from each of them; it’s a real joy playing with everyone.  Thile is a great musical mind.  He’s the rare combination of talent and a good person, so it’s a very happy combination.  The whole band gets along very well.  If it weren’t for the way the guys are, touring as hard as was we are wouldn’t be nearly as much fun.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks a lot for your time.  I’m looking forward to your show on Sunday.</strong>\r\n\r\nSo am I.  I’m thinking about stopping by campus ahead of time and getting some Joe Van Gogh or Loco Pops.', 'Interview: Punch Brothers ', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'interview-punch-brothers', '', '', '2010-11-09 05:55:18', '2010-11-09 05:55:18', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=254', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Winnie is trapped in a mound of dirt and thus is only visible from her waist up. Despite these unfortunate circumstances, she frequently (but rather unconvincingly) affirms that today will be a “happy day.” Her husband Willie’s lack of interest exaggerates the absurdity of her situation.\r\n\r\nAt first, Winnie presents a rough caricature of human behavior and leaves the audience unable to connect with her character. As the play progresses, Winnie expresses a wide range of emotions, rendering her vulnerable and therefore human.\r\n\r\nDespite this change, the portrayal of Winnie—played by longtime company member Julie Fishell—is still wholly unsatisfying. Fishell’s frequent silences seem to stem from a lack of preparation rather than from moments of intentional contemplation. The absent connection between the audience and Winnie is painfully evident, creating an uncomfortable environment that barely allows even awkward, forced laughs from the audience.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of life and human nature that form the essence of Happy Days is just as easily found in the script of the play itself—saving you a trip to the theater.\r\n\r\n—Ariel Smallwood\r\n\r\nHappy Days will run at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 8-11 and 2 p.m. Sept. 12 in PlayMakers’ Kenan Theatre at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Tickets are $10-$35 and may be purchased at <a href="http://www.playmakersrep.org/">www.playmakersrep.org</a> or by calling (919) 962-PLAY (7529).\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Happy Days review', 'PlayMakers Repertory Company opened its 2010-2011 season with Happy Days by Irish avant-grade playwright Samuel Beckett, best known for his drama Waiting for Godot.

We really liked the way those were working, and we think a lot of people did. We released one song, “Cameras,” and a lot of people really liked it but thought it sounded so different. And to me, it didn’t sound that different, but I guess I’ve been working on it for the whole past year, so it may have been a little too gradual for me to notice.\r\n\r\n[In creating Sidewalks,] there is a little more production value and whatnot because we did work with a producer and with studios—as opposed to the childhood bedroom that I grew up in, which is where we worked on <em>Grand</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>How has your sound evolved?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think we’re constantly evolving. When we started out this band and recorded our first demo, we were still learning how to play our instruments. Kim and I hopefully have gotten a little bit better—you can kind of follow the whole progression of us learning how to freakin’ play. But in the same sense, we really try to keep things simple. We have our saying, “WWMKD,” which is, “What would Matt and Kim do?” You know... just in case we start getting a little too musician-y. We try to keep it just a little “Matt and Kimmy”—if that can be a verb.\r\n\r\n<strong>What three words would you use to describe your relationship with Kim?</strong>\r\n\r\nThree words? I can paraphrase that in two: f—g magic. I say magic only because we spend every waking minute of every day for years and years together, and we have not gotten sick of each other; we have not wanted to kill each other; and I can only blame that on some sort of f—g magic.\r\n\r\n<strong>That’s amazing. Do you guys fight at all? Or argue?</strong>\r\n\r\nI mean, we’ll get slightly bitter or whatnot but very rarely. Most of the time, we just work. I mean, we shared a cell phone for five years because we were never apart from each other. I think that shows how well we get along.\r\n\r\n<strong>Your lyrics have such a stream-of-consciousness feel to it. Is the songwriting process as spontaneous as it seems?</strong>\r\n\r\nThat’s a lot how it goes. You go a lot on feeling—on what works and what doesn’t, and on deciding, oh, this song is going to be about some bulls*** breaking-up-with-a-girl. We don’t write love songs. Enough people have taken care of that. Also, a lot of times the singer will take care of all the lyrics, but Kim and I write together, which is also sort of bizarre.\r\n\r\n[Songwriting] is, in a way, stream-of-consciousness, but I think if you tie the right words together, it can make a whole new meaning in itself. Songs like “Lessons Learned” where the first words are, “Tape holds things that cannot stick”—I like that line, but it can mean something else, too. I want people to carve their own meanings out of things.\r\n\r\n<strong>Let’s talk about your videos in the last few minutes. They’re so interesting. In “Lessons Learned,” you two strip down in Times Square. In “5K,” your arms extend and you chop them off. Where do you get your inspiration?</strong>\r\n\r\nAs far as “Lessons Learned,” that was an idea I had come up with. At the time, I really wanted to make the most simple video we could that was still poignant. I wanted one shot, one camera—and I wondered, what would hold someone’s attention for three-and-a-half minutes? Well, two people stripping all their clothes off in the most public place in the United States: that could sell beyond watching the video.\r\n\r\nKim and I fall into a “cute” category a lot. I mean, we’re going to be ourselves, and being ourselves means Kim is always going to be smiley and we’re going to have a good time. We enjoy what we do and we let that show, but we like to counterbalance that. Rather than shoot videos where we’re on a swing-set with lollipops, how about we shoot something with tons of fake blood or with us stripping naked? We want to balance things out. Even though we’ve got to be ourselves, let’s not play into that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Well said. One more question. Do you have an idea for a video for “Cameras” yet?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, we do. We were going to shoot before we left on this tour, but we got a little too busy. So in November we’re shooting an idea that will definitely make some people angry, but hopefully it’ll make more people happy than it makes angry.', 'Interview: Matt & Kim', 'In advance of Matt & Kim''s upcoming, sold-out show at Cat''s Cradle on Wednesday Oct. 20, Recess'' Sanette Tanaka spoke to Matt Johnson about their new album, the group''s endearing music videos and sharing a cellphone with your significant other.

It''s a young Earth, with new heroes. The JSA existed back in the 40s, but the JLA has just gotten strong now and the heroes are celebrities in the public eye. Batman forms a covert-ops team out of the sidekicks of other heroes. Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, and Kid Flash go on a secret mission to Cadmus and find a certain Super boy.\r\n\r\nFor the laymen: we were shown the first act and an extended trailer of the first episode, an hour-long pilot, and while they claimed it was rough, it was easily ready for broadcast. It was so good that the audience demanded to see it again and the producers were more than happy to show it at the end of the panel, to even bigger cheers. The animation is slick and polished, the music is big and grand and the style (a mix of anime look with Western feel) is really something to see. It''s the kind of animated series people who aren''t fans of cartoons can easily get into. It''s fun, but serious, and the action is incredibly dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn typical Weisman fashion, there''s a deeper plot running through the show and a series of arcs that run in smaller pieces through the 26-episode season. Not only that, but Weisman repeatedly promised "150 characters from the DC Universe in [just the first] 18 episodes," which sounds like one hell of a feat.\r\n\r\nIf you need any other convincing, Batman will be a regular character and will be voiced by actor Bruce Greenwood, who is joining such other big names in the cast as Alan Tudyk as Green Arrow, Rob Lowe as Captain Marvel, and Jesse McCartney as Robin. Crispin Freeman, who joined the panel late (he apparently ran out of another panel to join us), voices Speedy and the Guardian. The voices all sounded great in the preview and only added to a beautifully visual show.\r\n\r\nOther team characters Artemis and Miss Martian will be introduced later, and Speedy seems to be missing from other promotional material, implying that all bets may be off in terms of the team always being the group set up in the pilot. What is certain is that, judging by the preview I saw, it''s going to a stellar series.\r\n\r\nYoung Justice premieres with a hour-long episode November 26th, with the rest of the series to follow beginning January 2011.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'Young Justice – New York Comic Con', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'young-justice-new-york-comic-con', '', '', '2011-01-17 04:34:55', '2011-01-17 04:34:55', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=183', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Now, Timm and the studio that created that legendary series and its 90s-00s follow-ups is bringing forth a new animation project for a new generation of children and grown-up fans alike.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern</em> is clearly in the very early stages, to the point where all the creators had to show were the first proof-of-concept test footage they ever created and the new (and in some cases incomplete) CGI models of the characters for use in the show.\r\n\r\nWhile <em>GL</em> is going all CGI with the characters, I''m not sure if the backgrounds we saw (painted to look like "vintage sci-fi book covers") will be similarly rendered in CG. The clash of styles may be a downside, but I have no way of telling if that''s going to be a fact or merely a fear going in. The CGI models of the characters invoke the Batman: Animated look beautifully and the test footage we saw was great.\r\n\r\nThere was also some great news for fans in that the reviled <a href="http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/Bat-Embargo" target="_blank">Embargo on DC characters</a> has been lifted across the board, so everyone from the comics is fair game for all future projects, which is quite a watershed moment for tie-in material.\r\n\r\nWhat is more interesting for long-time fans is that, even with the embargo lifted, the creators of the series have chosen the Red Lanterns as the central enemy of their first season. The Red Lanterns are a more recent addition to the GL stable of villains and were chosen over classic enemy Sinestro and his recently founded Sinestro Corps because of that character''s inclusion in the upcoming <em>Green Lantern</em> film starring Ryan Reynolds. According to Geoff Johns (current writer of <em>Green Lantern</em> and DC Entertainment''s Chief Creative Officer), there will be a "mystery set up" about the whereabouts of Sinestro that will lead to potential future stories.\r\n\r\nThe series seeks to be accessible to new fans just coming in from the Ryan Reynolds-led, Martin Campbell-directed feature as well, striving for open stories in a massive sandbox, but allowing connections with a small group of strong characters like Hal Jordan, Kilowog, and Aya (a new creation for the series "strongly tied into Green Lantern mythology"). It all sounds very in-progress, but also very exciting.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern: The Animated Series</em> will premiere with a Fall 2011 special and then continue in a series beginning Spring 2012.\r\n\r\n—<em>Michael Nixon</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'Green Lantern: The Animated Series – Saturday, Oct 9 – 2:30pm', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '140-revision-4', '', '', '2010-10-13 04:46:52', '2010-10-13 04:46:52', '', 140, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=153', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Consisting almost exclusively of covers of R&amp;B tracks from the ''60s and''70s, the record recalls time when music wasn’t just important but essential; when the Civil Rights movement had the country in turmoil and the musician was as much a political and social entity as an entertainer.\r\n\r\nLegend and the Roots, two of today’s most talented performers, drew inspiration for the album from Barack Obama’s 2008 election—they saw the landmark occasion as an opportunity to highlight the societal ills that continue to plague the nation into the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Themes that were so implemental in the social upheaval of the 1960s are shown to remain relevant thirty years later: “Our Generation (The Hope of the World)” echoes the uplifting, “Yes We Can” sentiment of Obama’s presidential campaign, while “I Can’t Write Left Handed,” originally a Vietnam War protest song, now resonates amid the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. If anything, Legend and the Roots prove that these issues endure and that music can still offer commentary and a call to action in a way nothing else can.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the music on this record that truly stirs the soul.

Hundreds of people, from filmmakers to athletes to administrators showed up to the event.  More powerful, however, were the throngs of Coach Buehler’s track athletes that had come back to Duke from all over the county.  “I’ve been looking forward to this for months and months and months,” said Jon Krassny, Trinity ‘74, adding that he “wouldn’t miss this for the word.”  Krassny and many other runners from multiple decades took this opportunity to reminisce about their experiences on the team.  “Coach has a unique way of dealing with talent,” said Larry Forrester, Trinity ‘72.  “Al’s genius was that he left us alone to find our own way to greatness.”  “He treated us like adults, ” added Peter Quance, Trinity ‘77. “The football coaches couldn’t believe we did all this on our own, that there was enough self-initiative,” said Joseph Browder, Trinity ’75.  The film’s director, Amy Unell, Trinity ‘03, said the turnout was indicative of Buehler’s impact upon people during his 55 years at Duke.<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter cocktails, the group moved to Griffith Theater for the screening of <em>The Coach Buehler Story</em>.  The film, despite its rough cut status, was met with thunderous applause and garnered much praise from the audience. “There was such an emotional connection in the audience; there was a lot of clapping, lots of tears,” Unell said.  “People came up to me balling, very emotionally moved.”  Unell also recounted stories of teachers who approached her who had been inspired to use some of Buehler’s sayings to enhance their teaching in the classroom.  “Coach is first and foremost a teacher…. And that’s what it’s all about,” she said.  Buehler himself thoroughly enjoyed the film.  “I thought it was super,” he said. “There was great photography and Grant Hill did a great job reading the script."\r\n\r\nThe film will take its message to audiences worldwide fairly soon, provided that it gains acceptance in the festival circuit. “We are tweaking it, editing it, getting it ready for film festivals,” Unell said.  And there’s already “lots of interest in distribution… on [television]” in addition other media outlets.  With all of the successes and attention the film has already enjoyed, <em>The Coach Buehler Story</em> is sure to allow Coach Buehler to spread his legendary coaching wisdom and impact many who have never even met him.\r\n\r\n<em>You can find out more about the film at <a href="http://www.coachbuehler.com" target="_blank">www.coachbuehler.com</a>.</em>', 'Starting at the Finish Line: The Coach Buehler Story — Rough Cut Screening', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '75-revision-12', '', '', '2010-10-18 17:27:39', '2010-10-18 17:27:39', '', 75, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=177', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ladies and gentlemen, <em>The Walking Dead</em> is the holy grail.\r\n\r\nSo yes, let’s get it out of the way immediately: I loved <em>The Walking Dead.</em>\r\n\r\nI’ve never read a single issue of the comic series by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard that this show is based on, but the collections were added to my Christmas list as soon as the pilot went to credits. It’s one of those rare projects built on the framework of a graphic novel that actually makes someone want to buy that original work, if only to see if it’s as good as the series or film that resulted.\r\n\r\nI’m not a horror fan by any means. I hate jumpy, shock horror and apparently <em>The Walking Dead</em> was too busy reading my mind on that to plan any of those schlocky, jump out of the dark moments. What you get with <em>Walking Dead</em> are slow, creeping moments of terror, moving towards the characters you care about, until you’re tensed up and yelling at the screen for Rick Grimes to turn around because that damn zombie (or “walker,” in the parlance of the pilot) is coming for him.\r\n\r\nThat slow, gradual terror gives the audience a lot of time with the characters too, reflecting on the real-life implications of a zombie outbreak, no longer just confined to a two-hour-movie-length of running and hiding in shambled houses, malls, and the like. <em>The Walking Dead</em> is about preparing, making plans, and scraping by in the face of endless swarms of the undead.\r\n\r\nAt the New York Comic Con, a packed theater full of fans was shown eight minutes of exclusive footage from the second episode of the season.  You can view the <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">trailer shown at NYCC </a><a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe horror''s not about the dead, it''s about living through it.\r\n\r\n<em>The Walking Dead</em> premieres October 31st at 10pm on AMC, starring Andrew Lincoln, Laurie Holden, and Jon Bernthal.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'The Walking Dead', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-walking-dead', '', '', '2011-01-27 01:25:36', '2011-01-27 01:25:36', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=218', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Not only that, but Weisman repeatedly promised "150 characters from the DC Universe in [just the first] 18 episodes," which sounds like one hell of a feat.\n\nIf you need any other convincing, Batman will be a regular character and will be voiced by actor Bruce Greenwood, who is joining such other big names in the cast as Alan Tudyk as Green Arrow, Rob Lowe as Captain Marvel, and Jesse McCartney as Robin. Crispin Freeman, who joined the panel late (he apparently ran out of another panel to join us), voices Speedy and the Guardian. The voices all sounded great in the preview and only added to a beautifully visual show.\n\nOther team characters Artemis and Miss Martian will be introduced later, and Speedy seems to be missing from other promotional material, implying that all bets may be off in terms of the team always being the group set up in the pilot. What is certain is that, judging by the preview I saw, it''s going to a stellar series.\n\nYoung Justice premieres with a hour-long episode November 26th, with the rest of the series to follow beginning January 2011.', 'Young Justice - New York Comic Con', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '183-revision', '', '', '2010-10-20 02:30:30', '2010-10-20 02:30:30', '', 183, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=184', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Now, Timm and the studio that created that legendary series and its 90s-00s follow-ups is bringing forth a new animation project for a new generation of children and grown-up fans alike.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern</em> is clearly in the very early stages, to the point where all the creators had to show were the first proof-of-concept test footage they ever created and the new (and in some cases incomplete) CGI models of the characters for use in the show.\r\n\r\nWhile <em>GL</em> is going all CGI with the characters, I''m not sure if the backgrounds we saw (painted to look like "vintage sci-fi book covers") will be similarly rendered in CG. The clash of styles may be a downside, but I have no way of telling if that''s going to be a fact or merely a fear going in. The CGI models of the characters invoke the Batman: Animated look beautifully and the test footage we saw was great.\r\n\r\nThere was also some great news for fans in that the reviled <a href="http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/Bat-Embargo" target="_blank">Embargo on DC characters</a> has been lifted across the board, so everyone from the comics is fair game for all future projects, which is quite a watershed moment for tie-in material.\r\n\r\nWhat is more interesting for long-time fans is that, even with the embargo lifted, the creators of the series have chosen the Red Lanterns as the central enemy of their first season. The Red Lanterns are a more recent addition to the GL stable of villains and were chosen over classic enemy Sinestro and his recently founded Sinestro Corps because of that character''s inclusion in the upcoming <em>Green Lantern</em> film starring Ryan Reynolds. According to Geoff Johns (current writer of <em>Green Lantern</em> and DC Entertainment''s Chief Creative Officer), there will be a "mystery set up" about the whereabouts of Sinestro that will lead to potential future stories.\r\n\r\nThe series seeks to be accessible to new fans just coming in from the Ryan Reynolds-led, Martin Campbell-directed feature as well, striving for open stories in a massive sandbox, but allowing connections with a small group of strong characters like Hal Jordan, Kilowog, and Aya (a new creation for the series "strongly tied into Green Lantern mythology"). It all sounds very in-progress, but also very exciting.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern: The Animated Series</em> will premiere with a Fall 2011 special and then continue in a series on Cartoon Network beginning Spring 2012.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'Green Lantern: The Animated Series – Saturday, October 9 – 2:30pm', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '140-revision-9', '', '', '2010-10-13 05:12:16', '2010-10-13 05:12:16', '', 140, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=192', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Now, Timm and the studio that created that legendary series and its 90s-00s follow-ups is bringing forth a new animation project for a new generation of children and grown-up fans alike.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern</em> is clearly in the very early stages, to the point where all the creators had to show were the first proof-of-concept test footage they ever created and the new (and in some cases incomplete) CGI models of the characters for use in the show.\r\n\r\nWhile <em>GL</em> is going all CGI with the characters, I''m not sure if the backgrounds we saw (painted to look like "vintage sci-fi book covers") will be similarly rendered in CG. The clash of styles may be a downside, but I have no way of telling if that''s going to be a fact or merely a fear going in. The CGI models of the characters invoke the Batman: Animated look beautifully and the test footage we saw was great.\r\n\r\nThere was also some great news for fans in that the reviled <a href="http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/Bat-Embargo" target="_blank">Embargo on DC characters</a> has been lifted across the board, so everyone from the comics is fair game for all future projects, which is quite a watershed moment for tie-in material.\r\n\r\nWhat is more interesting for long-time fans is that, even with the embargo lifted, the creators of the series have chosen the Red Lanterns as the central enemy of their first season. The Red Lanterns are a more recent addition to the GL stable of villains and were chosen over classic enemy Sinestro and his recently founded Sinestro Corps because of that character''s inclusion in the upcoming <em>Green Lantern</em> film starring Ryan Reynolds. According to Geoff Johns (current writer of <em>Green Lantern</em> and DC Entertainment''s Chief Creative Officer), there will be a "mystery set up" about the whereabouts of Sinestro that will lead to potential future stories.\r\n\r\nThe series seeks to be accessible to new fans just coming in from the Ryan Reynolds-led, Martin Campbell-directed feature as well, striving for open stories in a massive sandbox, but allowing connections with a small group of strong characters like Hal Jordan, Kilowog, and Aya (a new creation for the series "strongly tied into Green Lantern mythology"). It all sounds very in-progress, but also very exciting.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern: The Animated Series</em> will premiere with a Fall 2011 special and then continue in a series on Cartoon Network beginning Spring 2012.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'Green Lantern: The Animated Series – New York Comic Con', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '140-revision-10', '', '', '2010-10-20 02:37:00', '2010-10-20 02:37:00', '', 140, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=194', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

You’re not told what is right and wrong; you connect to the characters; your views change as you grow as a person.”\r\n\r\n<em>On Sexuality in the Show</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\nIn a comment that beautifully frames the discussion, Sackhoff said, “they wrote the characters first and then decided what gender they were.”  I really don’t need to say any more.  I’ll let Michelle Forbes, who played Admiral Cain, continue for me.\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n“I’ve been around forever and I’ve seen a lot change; I was around when it was complete objectification.  I think we’re in an incredibly healthy place right now, and I have no complaints…. It’s so easy to focus on what hasn’t been done and not to keep up with what’s going on today. We often forget to be proud of where we are…. I don’t feel that the chasm between men and women is there any more, but there’s always work to be done,” she said.\r\n\r\n“People like Rob Moore and Alan Ball are not afraid to put women in… very interesting situations, [but] networks still need to catch up,” she noted, adding, “We have a long road ahead of us in lots of other industries.”\r\n\r\nIn another beautiful comment, Sackhoff explained one of the central tenets of sexuality on the show, and perhaps of the show as a whole, “It’s love… it’s not about what you are but who you are.”\r\n\r\nNo, I swear I’m not a fan boy….\r\n\r\nOk, I’m lying.', 'The Women of Battlestar Galactica – New York Comic Con', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '197-revision-14', '', '', '2010-10-20 05:34:49', '2010-10-20 05:34:49', '', 197, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=228', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

It''s a young Earth, with new heroes. The JSA existed back in the 40s, but the JLA has just gotten strong now and the heroes are celebrities in the public eye. Batman forms a covert-ops team out of the sidekicks of other heroes. Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, and Kid Flash go on a secret mission to Cadmus and find a certain Super boy.\r\n\r\nFor the laymen: we were shown the first act and an extended trailer of the first episode, an hour-long pilot, and while they claimed it was rough, it was easily ready for broadcast. It was so good that the audience demanded to see it again and the producers were more than happy to show it at the end of the panel, to even bigger cheers. The animation is slick and polished, the music is big and grand and the style (a mix of anime look with Western feel) is really something to see. It''s the kind of animated series people who aren''t fans of cartoons can easily get into. It''s fun, but serious, and the action is incredibly dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn typical Weisman fashion, there''s a deeper plot running through the show and a series of arcs that run in smaller pieces through the 26-episode season. Not only that, but Weisman repeatedly promised "150 characters from the DC Universe in [just the first] 18 episodes," which sounds like one hell of a feat.\r\n\r\nIf you need any other convincing, Batman will be a regular character and will be voiced by actor Bruce Greenwood, who is joining such other big names in the cast as Alan Tudyk as Green Arrow, Rob Lowe as Captain Marvel, and Jesse McCartney as Robin. Crispin Freeman, who joined the panel late (he apparently ran out of another panel to join us), voices Speedy and the Guardian.

You’re not told what is right and wrong; you connect to the characters; your views change as you grow as a person.”\r\n\r\n<em>On Sexuality in the Show</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\nIn a comment that beautifully frames the discussion, Sackhoff said, “they wrote the characters first and then decided what gender they were.”  I really don’t need to say any more.  I’ll let Michelle Forbes, who played Admiral Cain, continue for me.\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n“I’ve been around forever and I’ve seen a lot change; I was around when it was complete objectification.  I think we’re in an incredibly healthy place right now, and I have no complaints…. It’s so easy to focus on what hasn’t been done and not to keep up with what’s going on today. We often forget to be proud of where we are…. I don’t feel that the chasm between men and women is there any more, but there’s always work to be done,” she said.\r\n\r\n“People like Rob Moore and Alan Ball are not afraid to put women in… very interesting situations, [but] networks still need to catch up,” she noted, adding, “We have a long road ahead of us in lots of other industries.”\r\n\r\nIn another beautiful comment, Sackhoff explained one of the central tenets of sexuality on the show, and perhaps of the show as a whole, “It’s love… it’s not about what you are but who you are.”\r\n\r\nNo, I swear I’m not a fan boy….\r\n\r\nOk, I’m lying.', 'The Women of Battlestar Galactica – New York Comic Con', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '197-revision-15', '', '', '2010-10-27 02:26:49', '2010-10-27 02:26:49', '', 197, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=231', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ladies and gentlemen, <em>The Walking Dead</em> is a holy grail.\r\n\r\nSo yes, let''s get it out of the way immediately: I loved <em>The Walking Dead.</em>\r\n\r\nI''ve never read a single issue of the comic series by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard that this show is based on, but the collections were added to my Christmas list as soon as the pilot went to credits. It''s one of those rare projects built on the framework of a graphic novel that actually makes someone want to buy that original work to see if it''s as good as the series or film that resulted from it.\r\n\r\nI''m not a horror fan by any means. I hate jumpy, shock horror moments, and apparently <em>The Walking Dead</em> was too busy reading my mind on that to plan any schlocky jump out of the dark moments. What you get with <em>Walking Dead</em> are slow, creeping moments of terror, moving towards the characters you care about, until you''re tensed up and yelling at the scream for Rick Grimes to turn around because that damn zombie (or "walker," in the parlance of the pilot) is coming for him.\r\n\r\nThat slow, gradual terror gives the audience a lot of time with the characters too, reflecting on the real-life implications of a zombie outbreak, no longer just confined to a movie world of two hours of running and hiding in shambled houses, malls, and the like. <em>The Walking Dead</em> is about preparing, making plans, and scraping by, facing the endless swarms of the undead.\r\n\r\nAt the New York Comic Con, a packed theater full of fans was shown eight minutes of exclusive footage from the second episode of the season.  You can view the <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">trailer shown at NYCC </a><a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe horror''s not about the dead, it''a about living through it.\r\n\r\n<em>The Walking Dead</em> premieres October 31st at 10pm on AMC, starring Andrew Lincoln, Laurie Holden, and Jon Bernthal.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'The Walking Dead', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '218-revision-9', '', '', '2010-10-27 02:27:03', '2010-10-27 02:27:03', '', 218, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=232', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The show was a real treat for old-school Outkast fans, hitting such staples as “B.O.B.”, “Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik”, “Player’s Ball”, “Elevators (Me &amp; You)” and “The Way You Move.” He didn’t totally ignore his solo career, though, ending the set with the raucous “Kryptonite (I’m On It)”, which had the whole Asheville Civic Center jumping. <strong>MGMT </strong>was up next but proved to be a disappointment, playing their songs exactly as they sound on the albums and failing to maintain Big Boi’s energy. Fortunately,<strong> RJD2</strong> rocked the house at the Orange Peel, demonstrating a certain virtuosity by mixing live on four separate turntables with a vast collection of vinyl. At some points his set was even too much for the venue to handle—“The Horror” was so bass-heavy that the house speakers almost blew out. Then, finishing out the night back at the Civic Center was popular mash-up artist <strong>Girl Talk</strong>. Inviting around 60 people to join him on stage, he proceeded to remix hundreds of songs from all over the musical spectrum into a rousing dance party that lasted until 2 a.m. Girl Talk himself was having as much fun as anyone in the crowd, so engrossed in the moment that he stripped his shirt off, jumped onto his stand and knocked the cord out of his laptop. Say what you will about his music’s artistic merit, or lack thereof—the man knows how to throw a party.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Saturday, October 30:</strong></em>\r\n\r\nWe started the second night off on a very different foot, catching the all-female folk trio <strong>Mountain Man</strong> at the intimate Thomas Wolfe Auditorium. They performed a short set—only half an hour—filled with haunting vocal harmonies, sometimes accompanied by a lone acoustic guitar and other times singing a cappella. For the last song they abandoned their microphones and stepped to the edge of the stage to sing directly to the audience, a testament to their impressive voices.<strong> Caribou</strong> was the first big act of the night, and they wowed the crowd with extended, psychedelic rhythmic workouts that drove both the artists and the audience to a fever pitch. Their high-energy show set the stage for the remainder of the night’s performers. <strong>Thievery Corporation</strong> followed with an exceptional concert, utilizing a bassist, sitar player, drummer, horn section, and a number of vocalists to complement their unique blend of down-tempo hip hop grooves and world music. Covering their whole catalog, from the classic “Lebanese Blonde” to the new “Radio Retaliation,” the group generated an incredibly vibrant, kinetic atmosphere, enticing the entire audience to dance along with them to a host of Latin, Eastern, and reggae rhythms. The highlight of the night, as well as the festival overall, though, was <strong>Massive Attack</strong>. Widely regarded as pioneers of trip-hop, the duo’s live show included two drummers, a bassist, guitar player, and several singers. Even more impressive was the LED light show in the background, which blasted a mix of psychedelia and socio-political commentary throughout the entire two-hour performance. The music and visuals combined to create an immersive, entrancing live experience that stands among the most impressive concerts I’ve ever seen.

To me music means exactly that, people who play instruments.  We play instruments that have rich traditions, but we try to be unique voices on the instruments; that’s what music is for me.\r\n\r\n<strong>Though you weren’t a member of the group when <em>Punch</em> [the band’s first record] was recorded, you’ve toured extensively for that album.  Do you feel that the band’s sound has changed or evolved?</strong>\r\n\r\nCertainly.  <em>Punch</em> contains a 42-minute, four-movement suite, “The Blind Leaving the Blind”, which is Thile’s composition.  <em>Antifogmatic</em> is a collection of shorter songs that are collaboratively written.  That’s a pretty major difference right there.  The nature of collaborative writing led to a more direct musical product: shorter songs, less of the long-form harmonic movements that writing solo can allow for. That’s the reason for the difference between the two records, the collaboration.\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve been known to play both album cuts and personal favorites, such as Strokes and Radiohead covers and classical pieces, in your live shows.  What’s in store for your show at Cat’s Cradle?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe really mix it up and we do try to cater to the particular venue and audience, since we play such a span of places.  We play everything from bars to larger concert halls where everyone’s seated; it’s a pretty big span.  Cat’s Cradle, I’ve never been there, but we’re probably going to rock a little bit more than usual.  I don’t think any Bach is in store for the show but you never know.  We’ll certainly be playing a lot of songs from the new record and the hits from old one.\r\n\r\n<strong>This is the fanboy in me talking, but what’s it like working with Chris Thile [of Nickel Creek fame]?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s been great.  I’ve been in the band for two years, and I’m the only member who is not original.  The whole band is astounding, every individual in the group.  I’ve learned a lot from each of them; it’s a real joy playing with everyone.  Thile is a great musical mind.  He’s the rare combination of talent and a good person, so it’s a very happy combination.  The whole band gets along very well.  If it weren’t for the way the guys are, touring as hard as was we are wouldn’t be nearly as much fun.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks a lot for your time.  I’m looking forward to your show on Sunday.</strong>\r\n\r\nSo am I.  I’m thinking about stopping by campus ahead of time and getting some Joe Van Gogh or Loco Pops.', 'Interview: Punch Brothers ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '254-revision-4', '', '', '2010-11-05 15:46:50', '2010-11-05 15:46:50', '', 254, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=258', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

To me music means exactly that, people who play instruments.  We play instruments that have rich traditions, but we try to be unique voices on the instruments; that’s what music is for me.\r\n\r\n<strong>Though you weren’t a member of the group when <em>Punch</em> [the band’s first record] was recorded, you’ve toured extensively for that album.  Do you feel that the band’s sound has changed or evolved?</strong>\r\n\r\nCertainly.  <em>Punch</em> contains a 42-minute, four-movement suite, “The Blind Leaving the Blind”, which is Thile’s composition.  <em>Antifogmatic</em> is a collection of shorter songs that are collaboratively written.  That’s a pretty major difference right there.  The nature of collaborative writing led to a more direct musical product: shorter songs, less of the long-form harmonic movements that writing solo can allow for. That’s the reason for the difference between the two records, the collaboration.\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve been known to play both album cuts and personal favorites, such as Strokes and Radiohead covers and classical pieces, in your live shows.  What’s in store for your show at Cat’s Cradle?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe really mix it up and we do try to cater to the particular venue and audience, since we play such a span of places.  We play everything from bars to larger concert halls where everyone’s seated; it’s a pretty big span.  Cat’s Cradle, I’ve never been there, but we’re probably going to rock a little bit more than usual.  I don’t think any Bach is in store for the show but you never know.  We’ll certainly be playing a lot of songs from the new record and the hits from old one.\r\n\r\n<strong>This is the fanboy in me talking, but what’s it like working with Chris Thile [of Nickel Creek fame]?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s been great.  I’ve been in the band for two years, and I’m the only member who is not original.  The whole band is astounding, every individual in the group.  I’ve learned a lot from each of them; it’s a real joy playing with everyone.  Thile is a great musical mind.  He’s the rare combination of talent and a good person, so it’s a very happy combination.  The whole band gets along very well.  If it weren’t for the way the guys are, touring as hard as was we are wouldn’t be nearly as much fun.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks a lot for your time.  I’m looking forward to your show on Sunday.</strong>\r\n\r\nSo am I.  I’m thinking about stopping by campus ahead of time and getting some Joe Van Gogh or Loco Pops.', 'Interview: Punch Brothers ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '254-revision-6', '', '', '2010-11-05 15:50:48', '2010-11-05 15:50:48', '', 254, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=260', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

To me music means exactly that, people who play instruments.  We play instruments that have rich traditions, but we try to be unique voices on the instruments; that’s what music is for me.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Though you weren’t a member of the group when <em>Punch</em> [the band’s first record] was recorded, you’ve toured extensively for that album.  Do you feel that the band’s sound has changed or evolved?</strong>\r\n\r\nCertainly.  <em>Punch</em> contains a 42-minute, four-movement suite, “The Blind Leaving the Blind”, which is Thile’s composition.  <em>Antifogmatic</em> is a collection of shorter songs that are collaboratively written.  That’s a pretty major difference right there.  The nature of collaborative writing led to a more direct musical product: shorter songs, less of the long-form harmonic movements that writing solo can allow for. That’s the reason for the difference between the two records, the collaboration.\r\n\r\n<strong>You’ve been known to play both album cuts and personal favorites, such as Strokes and Radiohead covers and classical pieces, in your live shows.  What’s in store for your show at Cat’s Cradle?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe really mix it up and we do try to cater to the particular venue and audience, since we play such a span of places.  We play everything from bars to larger concert halls where everyone’s seated; it’s a pretty big span.  Cat’s Cradle, I’ve never been there, but we’re probably going to rock a little bit more than usual.  I don’t think any Bach is in store for the show but you never know.  We’ll certainly be playing a lot of songs from the new record and the hits from old one.\r\n\r\n<strong>This is the fanboy in me talking, but what’s it like working with Chris Thile [of Nickel Creek fame]?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s been great.  I’ve been in the band for two years, and I’m the only member who is not original.  The whole band is astounding, every individual in the group.  I’ve learned a lot from each of them; it’s a real joy playing with everyone.  Thile is a great musical mind.  He’s the rare combination of talent and a good person, so it’s a very happy combination.  The whole band gets along very well.  If it weren’t for the way the guys are, touring as hard as was we are wouldn’t be nearly as much fun.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks a lot for your time.  I’m looking forward to your show on Sunday.</strong>\r\n\r\nSo am I.  I’m thinking about stopping by campus ahead of time and getting some Joe Van Gogh or Loco Pops.', 'Interview: Punch Brothers ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '254-revision-7', '', '', '2010-11-05 15:52:07', '2010-11-05 15:52:07', '', 254, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=268', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

An Entertainment: The Amazing Adventures of Louis de Rougemont (as told by hims</em><em>elf)—</em>a classic adventure story by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Donald Margulies. The show features protagonist Louis de Rougemont as he tells a captivating story of romance, suspense and triumph in the Seven Seas and in the Australian Outback.\r\n\r\nThe action-packed adventure follows Rougemont through his travels around the world after he ends up shipwrecked. He explains and illustrates a series of seemingly outlandish feats, such as riding a sea turtle and becoming a tribal leader. After he returns home to 1898 London, Rougemont faces skepticism and doubt as he tries to relay the events throughout the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nWhile the script was highly entertaining in itself, the versatility of the actors further highlighted the quick-paced, fluid nature of the production. Seven actors effectively played more than 80 roles. In particular, Derrick Ledbetter charmed the audience through his portrayal of Rougemont’s beloved dog Bruno; Ledbetter managed to elicit laughs while on all fours and without uttering one word of Victorian English.\r\n\r\nThe set remained static, and complex technological effects were kept at a minimum. The actors embellished the scenes through their performances and audio and visual effects. For example, actors on the stage clacked shells in tandem with Rougemont’s pearl shelling and shook thick sheets of aluminum foil to create the sounds for the heavy thunderstorms our hero encountered. Additionally, the actors seamlessly moved from background roles to prominent characters in Rougemont’s self-told story.\r\n\r\n<em>Shipwrecked!</em> is a family-oriented play that glorifies the high points of a man’s extravagant—almost crass—adventure within elitist Victorian society. This 90-minute, one-act play easily accommodates quick scene changes and a wide array of personas—watch carefully, even Queen Victoria makes an appearance.\r\n\r\nShipwrecked! <em>will run at 7:30 p.m. with matinees at 2 p.m. through Dec. 19 in PlayMakers’ Paul Green Theatre at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

And that’s what it’s all about,” she said.  Buehler himself thoroughly enjoyed the film.  “I thought it was super,” he said. “There was great photography and Grant Hill did a great job reading the script."\r\n\r\nThe film will take its message to audiences worldwide fairly soon, provided that it gains acceptance in the festival circuit. “We are tweaking it, editing it, getting it ready for film festivals,” Unell said.  And there’s already “lots of interest in distribution… on [television]” in addition to other media outlets.  With all of the successes and attention the film has already enjoyed, <em>The Coach Buehler Story</em> is sure to allow Coach Buehler to spread his legendary coaching wisdom and impact many who have never even met him.\r\n\r\n<em>You can find out more about the film at <a href="http://www.coachbuehler.com" target="_blank">www.coachbuehler.com</a>.</em>', 'Starting at the Finish Line: The Coach Buehler Story — Rough Cut Screening', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '75-revision-13', '', '', '2010-10-18 17:35:01', '2010-10-18 17:35:01', '', 75, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=285', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ladies and gentlemen, <em>The Walking Dead</em> is a holy grail.\r\n\r\nSo yes, let''s get it out of the way immediately: I loved <em>The Walking Dead.</em>\r\n\r\nI''ve never read a single issue of the comic series by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard that this show is based on, but the collections were added to my Christmas list as soon as the pilot went to credits. It''s one of those rare projects built on the framework of a graphic novel that actually makes someone want to buy that original work to see if it''s as good as the series or film that resulted from it.\r\n\r\nI''m not a horror fan by any means. I hate jumpy, shock horror moments, and apparently <em>The Walking Dead</em> was too busy reading my mind on that to plan any schlocky jump out of the dark moments. What you get with <em>Walking Dead</em> are slow, creeping moments of terror, moving towards the characters you care about, until you''re tensed up and yelling at the scream for Rick Grimes to turn around because that damn zombie (or "walker," in the parlance of the pilot) is coming for him.\r\n\r\nThat slow, gradual terror gives the audience a lot of time with the characters too, reflecting on the real-life implications of a zombie outbreak, no longer just confined to a movie world of two hours of running and hiding in shambled houses, malls, and the like. <em>The Walking Dead</em> is about preparing, making plans, and scraping by, facing the endless swarms of the undead.\r\n\r\nAt the New York Comic Con, a packed theater full of fans was shown eight minutes of exclusive footage from the second episode of the season.  You can view the <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">trailer shown at NYCC </a><a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe horror''s not about the dead, it''a about living through it.\r\n\r\n<em>The Walking Dead</em> premieres October 31st at 10pm on AMC, starring Andrew Lincoln, Laurie Holden, and Jon Bernthal.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'The Walking Dead', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '218-revision-10', '', '', '2010-10-27 02:28:11', '2010-10-27 02:28:11', '', 218, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=287', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

After an extensive search, a little sci-fi help, and a spot-on Will-Ferrell-as-Marlon-Brando-as-Jor-El impression, Megamind successfully creates a new super-hero to battle. But that is where the movie breaks down. The vocal talents of Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Jonah Hill simply can’t carry the thin plot and stumbling story line.\r\nFor a film targeted at kids, the humor and dialogue are too self-aware to be laugh-out-loud hilarious, and the plot is too complicated for the youngsters who would most likely see the film. The lack of resolution of moral issues within the film is too convoluted even for adults. The predominantly good Metro Man abandons the city and suffers no consequences, while Megamind’s transformation absolves him of responsibility for a lifetime of bad deeds. The plot issues don’t stop Ferrell and Fey from shining as voice actors throughout the film. Kids will love Ferrell as Megamind simply because he makes the character too ridiculous to resist, mispronouncing words in a way reminiscent of his role in Anchorman. Fey is equally impressive as a Lois Lane-esque reporter bent on stopping Megamind at every turn.\r\nThe unfamiliar plot and lack of emotion hinder Megamind from living up to recent animated blockbusters such as Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon. Nevertheless, Megamind is an admirable addition to the growing animated 3-D film genre.', 'Review: Megamind', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '276-revision-9', '', '', '2010-11-29 18:01:29', '2010-11-29 18:01:29', '', 276, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=294', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Their new album, <em>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</em> was hailed as "the greatest rock album of the year" even before its release. Sampling from rock sounds reminiscent of the Beatles, Elvis Presley, the Killers, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam blended with techno, punk and heavy synth, this album earns that brand.\r\n\r\nAffectionately known by fans as MCR, the group boasts true authenticity. Their sound doesn’t just stand out from other artists; each record tells a completely different story with a distinctive soundtrack to accompany it. This art of storytelling is one of MCR’s greatest strengths. In the past, these stories lamented the inevitability of death and pain while singer and front-man Gerard Way found new ways to look asphyxiated in sharp black clothing coupled with ghost white face makeup. Needless to say, the band quickly maintained a reputation for the glorification of a “goth” or “emo” lifestyle. The true appeal of <em>Danger Days</em>, however, is its freshness in comparison to MCR in the past.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the album was marked not by trauma or pain, but by Way’s love of comic books. Aided by past experience as a comic book author, he was inspired to create vigilante personas for each of the band members. These characters, the Killjoys, live in the deserts surrounding a concrete city in a world on the brink of an apocalypse. With laser guns and speeding cars, they fight against Better Living Industries (BL/ind), whose oppression rivals that found in George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>.  The album is not the soundtrack for this ‘comic book,’ but instead feels like an oral comic book you listen to instead of read.\r\n\r\n“Na Na Na,” the first single released from the album, is brimming with enthusiasm and raw power, with Way practically shouting about the rebellious lives of the Killjoys and the decimated freedom they must protect. The music videos for “Na Na Na” and “Sing” are as essential to the album’s plotline as the songs are. Earning almost as much support as the video for “I’m Not Okay” (from the album <em>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</em>), they explain the Killjoy’s mission with details that could only be speculated about with the music alone.\r\n\r\nDespite the success of the singles and videos, some devoted fans have been critical of the album. Honestly, <em>Danger Days</em> cannot compare to the genius of its predecessor, <em>The Black Parade</em>.

Surfer Blood''s <em>Astro Coast</em> is everything <em>The Suburbs</em> isn''t: witty, contemporary, fun and jacked up with real doses of what it''s like to be a smart, understimulated kid watching David Lynch flicks with a girl he can''t quite read. And "Catholic Pagans," with its bellicose chorus and story of someone getting their act together for a girl, maybe that same girl, makes rock and roll sound redemptive again.\r\n\r\n8.

Songwriter Dr. Luke has had <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/05/surveying_the_d.php">an Olympian year</a>, and Perry turns his feverish, hopeful lyrics—"Let me be your teenage dream tonight"—into a paean for American youth.\r\n\r\n7.

The beat adds nicely to "Pop the Trunk"''s dramatic sensibility, stuttering along and then blowing up big for emphasis when Yela gets to the good parts.\r\n\r\n6.

Made up of a bunch of hyperliterate music critics, these guys steep their vicious guitar-and-drums in layered histories of rock and roll; you can practically hear the footnotes, and it''s totally refreshing.

But I''ll keep it short. On "Runaway," Kanye takes a stained-glass-and-sunlight-gorgeous beat and treats it like someone he loves, with all the pathos, adornments and indulgences this metaphor might suggest. Between Kanye''s shredded singing and the samples like rough surf, Pusha T''s scalpel of a verse and what might be history''s most deranged use of vocoder, we''re given something that feels like it should be hung in galleries, a piece that begs to be framed and looked at over and over, its wrinkles memorized and its colors made intimate.\r\n\r\nHonorable mentions: Waka Flocka Flame, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLkWaNltT54">"Hard in the Paint"</a>; Vampire Weekend, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bccKotFwzoY">"Giving Up the Gun"</a>; Tokyo Police Club, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAxRozTgoXM">"Wait Up (Boots of Danger)"</a>; Titus Andronicus, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZYignZ2HfE">"The Battle of Hampton Roads"</a>; Superchunk, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6R76hyejxo">"Learned to Surf"</a>; Spoon, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4Q9zngV52U">"Got Nuffin"</a>; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhYYd5adVY4">pretty</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kJ05P-71gY">much</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z8ppcFGPlY">every</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLRnmQ-4Yp0">song</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ld-0na1mpI">on</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SyEwLREPs4">Sleigh</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-03pAns2Ta0">Bells</a>'' <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnSuRHiW988"><em>Treats</em></a>; Rihanna ft.

John Legend &amp; The Roots – <a title="Hard Times" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOgkRniSNTs">Hard Times</a>\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, 2010 should be remembered as the year of collaborations. After hearing “Hard Times,” one wonders how no one thought to bring the politically conscious hip-hop of The Roots and the soulful, impassioned voice of John Legend together earlier. The resulting track is powerful in its scope, and a bold statement from this collaboration of legendary artists.\r\n\r\n9. Four Tet – <a title="Love Cry" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urOUJMTZdD8">Love Cry</a>\r\n\r\nFour Tet has been around for a long time – enough to witness and participate in the changing electronic trends over the years – and “Love Cry” proves it. The nearly 10 minute long piece takes listeners through myriad styles, from stark minimalism to pulsating dance beats and back.\r\n\r\n8. Shad – <a title="Rose Garden" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-mAMH5S6VA">Rose Garden</a>\r\n\r\nUndeniably witty with its lyricism and unbelievably catchy with its choice of backing samples, “Rose Garden” is how you make a hip-hop song for the ages. It’s so brief that you’ll be listening to it again and again to pick up on all the clever lyrical references and the fantastic guest contribution from Lisa Lobsinger, of Broken Social Scene and Reverie Sound Revue.\r\n\r\n7. Broken Social Scene – <a title="World Sick" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb9WKJhqVWs">World Sick</a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, no one can deny that Broken Social Scene has a talent for epic, climax-laden songs. “World Sick” is no exception, with its anthemic chorus and the staggering creative weight of its multiple collaborators. Nothing introduces an album quite like this track does.\r\n\r\n6. Baths – <a title="Hall" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJhgsrqTzSk">Hall</a>\r\n\r\nIf you’ve never listened to chillwave or its derivative genres, this is a place to start. A newcomer to the scene, Baths proves his mastery over the craft, marrying a glitchy, sonic landscape with blissful, nonsensical vocals. It is a brief glimpse into the dreamscape of the artist, with it swirling sounds and imagery.\r\n\r\n5. Crystal Castles – <a title="Celestica" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsxNUl1IHnE">Celestica</a>\r\n\r\nWhile no one doubts the duo’s ability at driving, wild dance music, “Celestica” reminds us that they’re no one-trick pony. This is Alice Glass at her most hauntingly fragile, and her vocal power is on full display here. It’s a fleeting, serene moment: the calm in the midst of a veritable electro storm.\r\n\r\n4. Kanye West - <a title="All Of The Lights" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjX4ZCJX0sI">All Of The Lights</a>\r\n\r\nWhat hasn’t already been said? “All Of The Lights” is everything you would need to know about Kanye''s latest album: it''s bombastic, loaded with a stunning variety of guests, unapologetic with its lyrics, and absolutely infectious. It’s a towering accomplishment in intricate instrumentation, and for once, Kanye’s lyrics actually are a highlight, as opposed to a mild distraction.\r\n\r\n3. Yeasayer - <a title="Ambling Alp" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6VatNuR_Uk">Ambling Alp</a>\r\n\r\nNot even the most diehard of electronic skeptics can fault this song for lacking emotion and humanity. Even with the layers of samples and drum machines, this is a truly heartfelt, organic track, with its aphorism-laden lyrics and vocals. Who would have thought that, of all people, the bizarre, ineffable Yeasayer would be delivering the most poignant musical message of 2010?\r\n\r\n2. The Love Language - <a title="Brittany''s Back" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMoW37gI66s">Brittany''s Back</a>\r\n\r\nWith its churning, pounding rhythm section and blend of distorted vocals with crisp, clean instrumentation, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a catchier rock song this year. It’s a throwback to older, perhaps simpler days of rock and roll – a rare sight these days. The half-sung, half-shouted vocals are both infectious and heartfelt, and the song is over so quickly that you’ll find it on repeat again and again.\r\n\r\n1. Arcade Fire - <a title="Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH_7_XRfTMs">Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond  Mountains)</a>\r\n\r\nLet''s get this out of the way now - I was vastly disappointed by <em>The Suburbs</em>. I get what Arcade Fire were trying to do, I really do; but to me, there was only one track where their longing for the suburbia of their youth came through: "Sprawl II." As a child of the suburbs myself, it is both devastating and uplifting simultaneously. Despite the shift in direction for the album, Sprawl II is pure, vintage Arcade Fire: sweeping in its orchestral construction and nostalgic with its lyricism, leaving us both joyous and drained with every listen.\r\n\r\nHonorable Mentions:\r\n\r\nBonobo - <a title="Prelude/Kiara" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7m86aMNjlQ">Prelude/Kiara</a>\r\n\r\nDaft Punk - <a title="Solar Sailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRvVyMuWbpM">Solar Sailer</a>\r\n\r\nceo - <a title="Come With Me" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T74frXBpgk">Come With Me</a>\r\n\r\nCults - <a title="Go Outside" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHhEBqRTXdk">Go Outside</a>\r\n\r\nBig Boi - <a title="Night Night" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1j3RfC_rJI">Night Night</a>\r\n\r\nLCD Soundsystem - <a title="All I Want" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLPeQ9U_f-0">All I Want</a>\r\n\r\nMassive Attack - <a title="United Snakes" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJtY83I8bMs">United Snakes</a>\r\n\r\nBonnie ''Prince'' Billy &amp; The Cairo Gang - <a title="The Sounds Are Always Begging" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXWpr_7J0s">The Sounds Are Always Begging</a>', 'Top 10 Songs of 2010 pt. 3—Jeff Shi', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'top-10-songs-of-2010-pt-3%e2%80%94jeff-shi-2', '', '', '2010-12-18 01:16:27', '2010-12-18 01:16:27', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=333', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It is a brief glimpse into the dreamscape of the artist, with it swirling sounds and imagery.\r\n\r\n5. Crystal Castles – <a title="Celestica" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsxNUl1IHnE">Celestica</a>\r\n\r\nWhile no one doubts the duo’s ability at driving, wild dance music, “Celestica” reminds us that they’re no one-trick pony. This is Alice Glass at her most hauntingly fragile, and her vocal power is on full display here. It’s a fleeting, serene moment: the calm in the midst of a veritable electro storm.\r\n\r\n4. Kanye West - <a title="All Of The Lights" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjX4ZCJX0sI">All Of The Lights</a>\r\n\r\nWhat hasn’t already been said? “All Of The Lights” is everything you would need to know about Kanye''s latest album: it''s bombastic, loaded with a stunning variety of guests, unapologetic with its lyrics, and absolutely infectious. It’s a towering accomplishment in intricate instrumentation, and for once, Kanye’s lyrics actually are a highlight, as opposed to a mild distraction.\r\n\r\n3. Yeasayer - <a title="Ambling Alp" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6VatNuR_Uk">Ambling Alp</a>\r\n\r\nNot even the most diehard of electronic skeptics can fault this song for lacking emotion and humanity. Even with the layers of samples and drum machines, this is a truly heartfelt, organic track, with its aphorism-laden lyrics and vocals. Who would have thought that, of all people, the bizarre, ineffable Yeasayer would be delivering the most poignant musical message of 2010?\r\n\r\n2. The Love Language - <a title="Brittany''s Back" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMoW37gI66s">Brittany''s Back</a>\r\n\r\nWith its churning, pounding rhythm section and blend of distorted vocals with crisp, clean instrumentation, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a catchier rock song this year. It’s a throwback to older, perhaps simpler days of rock and roll – a rare sight these days. The half-sung, half-shouted vocals are both infectious and heartfelt, and the song is over so quickly that you’ll find it on repeat again and again.\r\n\r\n1.

I get what they were doing, I really do: but to me, there was only one track where their longing for the suburbia of their youth came through. Sprawl II is the one, and as a child of the suburbs myself, it is both devastating and uplifting at th same time. Despite the shift in direction for the album, Sprawl II is pure, vintage Arcade Fire: sweeping in its orchestral construction and nostalgic in its lyricism, leaving us both joyous and drained with every listen.\r\n\r\nHonorable Mentions:\r\n\r\nBonobo - <a title="Prelude/Kiara" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7m86aMNjlQ">Prelude/Kiara</a>\r\n\r\nDaft Punk - <a title="Solar Sailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRvVyMuWbpM">Solar Sailer</a>\r\n\r\nceo - <a title="Come With Me" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T74frXBpgk">Come With Me</a>\r\n\r\nCults - <a title="Go Outside" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHhEBqRTXdk">Go Outside</a>\r\n\r\nBig Boi - <a title="Night Night" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1j3RfC_rJI">Night Night</a>\r\n\r\nLCD Soundsystem - <a title="All I Want" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLPeQ9U_f-0">All I Want</a>\r\n\r\nMassive Attack - <a title="United Snakes" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJtY83I8bMs">United Snakes</a>\r\n\r\nBonnie ''Prince'' Billy &amp; The Cairo Gang - <a title="The Sounds Are Always Begging" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXWpr_7J0s">The Sounds Are Always Begging</a>', 'Top 10 Songs of 2010 pt. 3—Jeff Shi', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '333-revision-4', '', '', '2010-12-17 23:26:52', '2010-12-17 23:26:52', '', 333, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=337', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

But I wasn’t really influenced by it; I really could never even try to be influenced by it because it’s such a masterpiece and the dance sequences were so ahead of their time. I just kept it in the back [of my mind].”\r\n\r\nWhether intentional or not, Arronofsky delves into the same themes to a level with which 1948 audiences may not have been comfortable.  The Archers, as well as Aronofsky, were/are consumed with the exploration of the multi-dimensionality of human nature.  Victoria “Vicky” Page (Moira Shearer), much like Nina, struggles for perfection in two different capacities and in the end finds herself defeated by both.  In <em>The Red Shoes</em>, director Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) tells Vicky, “you can’t have two lives,” while <em>Black Swan</em>’s director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), encourages Nina to find the darkness in her life, telling her “the only person standing in your way is you.”  Both film acknowledge the impossibility of the task and see the quests’ victims jump off precipices of both physicality and emotion, leaving their bodies and spirits maimed.\r\n\r\nBeing the perfect metaphor that they are for duplicity, both films use mirrors to profound effect.  Nina’s self-reflections and descent into madness begin and end in front of mirrors.  At times, they transcend the physical mirrors, climaxing in the frenzied, chromatic club scene in which we lose track of Nina and she loses herself.  She welcomes in the darkness and becomes one with its physical and emotional manifestations, consummating in her sexual union with Lily (Mila Kunis) in the next scene.  After her drug-induced stupor, Nina returns to her dressing room mirror for her premiere performance, where she has a haunting encounter with both her doppelgänger and Lily, between whom the borders are very unclear at this point in the film.  Interestingly, Nina smashes the mirror and uses its shards as a weapon; the damage she inflicts upon an imaginary Lily and upon the black swan reflects itself upon not only the Swan Queen, but also upon Nina herself.  She attempts to break her own newfound duplicity, but in the end it breaks her.\r\n\r\nThe usage of mirrors in <em>The Red Shoes</em> was both revolutionary and disturbing for its time.  In Vicky’s performance of the eponymous ballet, her character’s dreams of dancing forever are captured through a complex projector-mirror system that shows her twirling reflection in the shoe store window.  The notion of dancing forever, of course, is the cause of her eventual death, and the images reflected in the mirrors become more sinister as the ballet progresses, showing horrifying and lewd images of a circus as it descends into sinful nightlife.  The scene during which Lermontov smashes a mirror, reflecting his broken dreams for Vicky, is reserved for the privacy of backstage.  Here is a man who, much unlike Nina’s Leroy, discourages his vedette from leading two lives.  He even denies himself the sight of his own dual nature, suppressing his romantic interest in Vicky for the love of dance, knowing that he cannot have both.\r\n\r\nThe innovative rendering of dance in Powell and Pressburger’s film amazed critics and immortalized the work in the cinematic canon.  However, back in the days of Technicolor Process Four and massive three-strip cameras, shots were very tied-down and required massive lights.  The amount of movement achieved in the dance scene was a huge undertaking.  With the advancements in film over the last several decades, as well as Aronofsky’s decision to shoot on Super 16 and digital, he and director of photography Matthew Libatique achieved a poetic dance with the camera that transports audiences much further into the experience than was previously possible.\r\n\r\nThe smaller, more light-sensitive cameras also allowed a much more personal, gritty feel to the film.  As Leroy says of his run of <em>Swan Lake</em>, he wants something “visceral and real,” and that manifests itself not just in the on-stage performance but also on screen.  Aronofsky finds his reality and his truth in the greys of life, a theme that has manifested itself more in his films as his visual language has matured.  In fact, much of the film takes place in the grey cinder blocks of the dressing and rehearsal rooms in which Nina undergoes her transformation.  She even rejects her pink stuffed animals from her room, leaving only the choice between black and white and coming up with the answer of grey.\r\n\r\nBoth <em>The Red Shoes</em> and <em>Black Swan</em> are based on simple fairy tales, but both are revolutionary in their complexity.  The two take place in the realm of the greys, with Aronofsky taking the visual conversation to a new level not feasible in the Technicolor era.    Curiously, while the end of <em>The Red </em>Shoes clearly ends with Vicky’s death and inability to choose between love and art, the ending of <em>Black Swan</em> is maddeningly unclear. It could be Nina who dies, her white incarnation, even her black incarnation.  It poses more of a question than an answer, but both still come to the same conclusion: There is no right or wrong, there is no black and white, there is only humanity.\r\n\r\nBlack Swan<em> is currently in theaters nationwide, distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures.  The award-winning 2009 restoration of </em>The Red Shoes<em> is available on DVD and Blu-ray from The Criterion Collection.  Trailers for the two films can be seen here: <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/blackswan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: normal;">Black Swan</span></a><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span>&amp;<span style="font-style: normal;"> </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcOqyWBKYg" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: normal;">The Red Shoes</span></a></em>', 'Black and White and Red All Over: Black Swan''s Intimate Dance with The Red Shoes', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'black-and-white-and-red-all-over-black-swans-intimate-dance-with-the-red-shoes', '', '', '2011-01-04 08:03:54', '2011-01-04 08:03:54', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=368', 0, 'post', '', 0);

But I wasn’t really influenced by it; I really could never even try to be influenced by it because it’s such a masterpiece and the dance sequences were so ahead of their time.

I just kept it in the back [of my mind].”\r\n\r\nWhether intentional or not, Arronofsky delves into the same themes to a level with which 1948 audiences may not have been comfortable.  The Archers, as well as Aronofsky, were/are consumed with the exploration of the multi-dimensionality of human nature.  Victoria “Vicky” Page (Moira Shearer), much like Nina, struggles for perfection in two different capacities and in the end finds herself defeated by both.  In <em>The Red Shoes</em>, director Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) tells Vicky, “you can’t have two lives,” while <em>Black Swan</em>’s director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), encourages Nina to find the darkness in her life, telling her “the only person standing in your way is you.”  Both film acknowledge the impossibility of the task and see the quests’ victims jump off precipices of both physicality and emotion, leaving their bodies and spirits maimed.\r\n\r\nBeing the perfect metaphor that they are for duplicity, both films use mirrors to profound effect.  Nina’s self-reflections and descent into madness begin and end in front of mirrors.  At times, they transcend the physical mirrors, climaxing in the frenzied, chromatic club scene in which we lose track of Nina and she loses herself.  She welcomes in the darkness and becomes one with its physical and emotional manifestations, consummating in her sexual union with Lily (Mila Kunis) in the next scene.  After her drug-induced stupor, Nina returns to her dressing room mirror for her premiere performance, where she has a haunting encounter with both her doppelgänger and Lily, between whom the borders are very unclear at this point in the film.  Interestingly, Nina smashes the mirror and uses its shards as a weapon; the damage she inflicts upon an imaginary Lily and upon the black swan reflects itself upon not only the Swan Queen, but also upon Nina herself.  She attempts to break her own newfound duplicity, but in the end it breaks her.\r\n\r\nThe usage of mirrors in <em>The Red Shoes</em> was both revolutionary and disturbing for its time.  In Vicky’s performance of the eponymous ballet, her character’s dreams of dancing forever are captured through a complex projector-mirror system that shows her twirling reflection in the shoe store window.  The notion of dancing forever, of course, is the cause of her eventual death, and the images reflected in the mirrors become more sinister as the ballet progresses, showing horrifying and lewd images of a circus as it descends into sinful nightlife.  The scene during which Lermontov smashes a mirror, reflecting his broken dreams for Vicky, is reserved for the privacy of backstage.  Here is a man who, much unlike Nina’s Leroy, discourages his vedette from leading two lives.  He even denies himself the sight of his own dual nature, suppressing his romantic interest in Vicky for the love of dance, knowing that he cannot have both.\r\n\r\nThe innovative rendering of dance in Powell and Pressburger’s film amazed critics and immortalized the work in the cinematic canon.  However, back in the days of Technicolor Process Four and massive three-strip cameras, shots were very tied-down and required massive lights.  The amount of movement achieved in the dance scene was a huge undertaking.  With the advancements in film over the last several decades, as well as Aronofsky’s decision to shoot on Super 16 and digital, he and director of photography Matthew Libatique achieved a poetic dance with the camera that transports audiences much further into the experience than was previously possible.\r\n\r\nThe smaller, more light-sensitive cameras also allowed a much more personal, gritty feel to the film.  As Leroy says of his run of <em>Swan Lake</em>, he wants something “visceral and real,” and that manifests itself not just in the on-stage performance but also on screen.  Aronofsky finds his reality and his truth in the greys of life, a theme that has manifested itself more in his films as his visual language has matured.  In fact, much of the film takes place in the grey cinder blocks of the dressing and rehearsal rooms in which Nina undergoes her transformation.  She even rejects her pink stuffed animals from her room, leaving only the choice between black and white and coming up with the answer of grey.\r\n\r\nBoth <em>The Red Shoes</em> and <em>Black Swan</em> are based on simple fairy tales, but both are revolutionary in their complexity.  The two take place in the realm of the greys, with Aronofsky taking the visual conversation to a new level not feasible in the Technicolor era.    Curiously, while the end of <em>The Red </em>Shoes clearly ends with Vicky’s death and inability to choose between love and art, the ending of <em>Black Swan</em> is maddeningly unclear. It could be Nina who dies, her white incarnation, even her black incarnation.  It poses more of a question than an answer, but both still come to the same conclusion: There is no right or wrong, there is no black and white, there is only humanity.\r\n\r\nBlack Swan<em> is currently in theaters nationwide, distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures.  The award-winning 2009 restoration of </em>The Red Shoes<em> is available on DVD and Blu-ray from The Criterion Collection.  Trailers for the two films can be seen here: <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/blackswan/" target="_blank">Black Swan</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcOqyWBKYg" target="_blank">The Red Shoes</a></em>', 'Black and White and Red All Over: Black Swan''s Intimate Dance with The Red Shoes', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '368-revision-10', '', '', '2011-01-04 08:02:53', '2011-01-04 08:02:53', '', 368, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=380', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I had to look away multiple times (that''s the first time I''ve done that since No Country For Old Men).  My friend who saw it with me said that he didn''t dare touch his drink for the entire second half of the film because he was so tense.  It was an artistic masterpiece with unbelievable acting and impeccable direction.\r\n\r\n2) <em>Social Network</em> - I wanted this to be the best picture.  Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake all give fantastic performances, layered on top of a marvelously paced and witty screenplay.  That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\r\n\r\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.  Christopher Nolan might be my favorite director.  I have seen almost all of Joseph Gordon Levitt''s movies.  Do I really need to explain more?\r\n\r\n5) <em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Simple and elegant.  Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield all give powerful performances that break through the barrier between you and disbelief, and make you feel their plight as your own.  Gorgeous art direction and cinematography, complete with a moving and ultimately human story.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Comedy TV Shows (for those of us who aren''t "mature" or pretentious enough to gab about serious dramas):</strong>\r\n\r\n1) <em>Community</em> - This show is a work of genius.  Every episode finds a way to top the last.  Whether it is a dramatic episode about Troy''s birthday or a parody of <em>Apollo 13</em>, this show continues to find success in everything it does.\r\n\r\n2) <em>The League</em> - Most TV shows have at least one character that you get annoyed with.  On <em>It''s Always Sunny</em>, I usually get annoyed with Sweet Dee. On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\r\n\r\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\r\n\r\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\r\n\r\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\r\n\r\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman!

That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\r\n\r\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.

On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) It''s a toss up: everyone tells me that <em>Modern Family</em> is crazy good; I''ve seen a few episodes of <em>Bored To Death</em> and I loved the blend of comedy and noir; my trusted TV source tells me that <em>Parks and Rec</em> is where it''s at, and I can hardly argue because I love Aziz Ansari.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\r\n\r\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\r\n\r\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\r\n\r\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\r\n\r\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman!

On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\r\n\r\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\r\n\r\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\r\n\r\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\r\n\r\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman!

I had to look away multiple times (that''s the first time I''ve done that since No Country For Old Men).  My friend who saw it with me said that he didn''t dare touch his drink for the entire second half of the film because he was so tense.  It was an artistic masterpiece with unbelievable acting and impeccable direction.\r\n\r\n2) <em>Social Network</em> - I wanted this to be the best picture.  Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake all give fantastic performances, layered on top of a marvelously paced and witty screenplay.  That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\r\n\r\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.  Christopher Nolan might be my favorite director.  I have seen almost all of Joseph Gordon Levitt''s movies.  Do I really need to explain more?\r\n\r\n5) <em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Simple and elegant.  Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield all give powerful performances that break through the barrier between you and disbelief, and make you feel their plight as your own.  Gorgeous art direction and cinematography, complete with a moving and ultimately human story.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Comedy TV Shows (for those of us who aren''t "mature" or pretentious enough to gab about serious dramas):</strong>\r\n\r\n1) <em>Community</em> - This show is a work of genius.  Every episode finds a way to top the last.  Whether it is a dramatic episode about Troy''s birthday or a parody of <em>Apollo 13</em>, this show continues to find success in everything it does.\r\n\r\n2) <em>The League</em> - Most TV shows have at least one character that you get annoyed with.  On <em>It''s Always Sunny</em>, I usually get annoyed with Sweet Dee. On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\r\n\r\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\r\n\r\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\r\n\r\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\r\n\r\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman!

I had to look away multiple times (that''s the first time I''ve done that since No Country For Old Men).  My friend who saw it with me said that he didn''t dare touch his drink for the entire second half of the film because he was so tense.  It was an artistic masterpiece with unbelievable acting and impeccable direction.\r\n\r\n2) <em>Social Network</em> - I wanted this to be the best picture.  Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake all give fantastic performances, layered on top of a marvelously paced and witty screenplay.  That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\r\n\r\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.  Christopher Nolan might be my favorite director.  I have seen almost all of Joseph Gordon Levitt''s movies.  Do I really need to explain more?\r\n\r\n5) <em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Simple and elegant.  Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield all give powerful performances that break through the barrier between you and disbelief, and make you feel their plight as your own.  Gorgeous art direction and cinematography, complete with a moving and ultimately human story.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Comedy TV Shows (for those of us who aren''t "mature" or pretentious enough to gab about serious dramas):</strong>\r\n\r\n1) <em>Community</em> - This show is a work of genius.  Every episode finds a way to top the last.  Whether it is a dramatic episode about Troy''s birthday or a parody of <em>Apollo 13</em>, this show continues to find success in everything it does.\r\n\r\n2) <em>The League</em> - Most TV shows have at least one character that you get annoyed with.  On <em>It''s Always Sunny</em>, I usually get annoyed with Sweet Dee. On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\r\n\r\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\r\n\r\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\r\n\r\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\r\n\r\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman!

I had to look away multiple times (that''s the first time I''ve done that since No Country For Old Men).  My friend who saw it with me said that he didn''t dare touch his drink for the entire second half of the film because he was so tense.  It was an artistic masterpiece with unbelievable acting and impeccable direction.\n\n2) <em>Social Network</em> - I wanted this to be the best picture.  Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake all give fantastic performances, layered on top of a marvelously paced and witty screenplay.  That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\n\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\n\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.  Christopher Nolan might be my favorite director.  I have seen almost all of Joseph Gordon Levitt''s movies.  Do I really need to explain more?\n\n5) <em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Simple and elegant.  Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield all give powerful performances that break through the barrier between you and disbelief, and make you feel their plight as your own.  Gorgeous art direction and cinematography, complete with a moving and ultimately human story.\n<div>\n\n<strong>Best Comedy TV Shows (for those of us who aren''t "mature" or pretentious enough to gab about serious dramas):</strong>\n\n1) <em>Community</em> - This show is a work of genius.  Every episode finds a way to top the last.  Whether it is a dramatic episode about Troy''s birthday or a parody of <em>Apollo 13</em>, this show continues to find success in everything it does.\n\n2) <em>The League</em> - Most TV shows have at least one character that you get annoyed with.  On <em>It''s Always Sunny</em>, I usually get annoyed with Sweet Dee. On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\n\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\n\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\n\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\n\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\n\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\n\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\n\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\n\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman!

I had to look away multiple times (that''s the first time I''ve done that since No Country For Old Men).  My friend who saw it with me said that he didn''t dare touch his drink for the entire second half of the film because he was so tense.  It was an artistic masterpiece with unbelievable acting and impeccable direction.\r\n\r\n2) <em>Social Network</em> - I wanted this to be the best picture.  Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake all give fantastic performances, layered on top of a marvelously paced and witty screenplay.  That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\r\n\r\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.  Christopher Nolan might be my favorite director.  I have seen almost all of Joseph Gordon Levitt''s movies.  Do I really need to explain more?\r\n\r\n5) <em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Simple and elegant.  Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield all give powerful performances that break through the barrier between you and disbelief, and make you feel their plight as your own.  Gorgeous art direction and cinematography, complete with a moving and ultimately human story.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Comedy TV Shows (for those of us who aren''t "mature" or pretentious enough to gab about serious dramas):</strong>\r\n\r\n1) <em>Community</em> - This show is a work of genius.  Every episode finds a way to top the last.  Whether it is a dramatic episode about Troy''s birthday or a parody of <em>Apollo 13</em>, this show continues to find success in everything it does.\r\n\r\n2) <em>The League</em> - Most TV shows have at least one character that you get annoyed with.  On <em>It''s Always Sunny</em>, I usually get annoyed with Sweet Dee. On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad?

In advance of the performance, Recess'' Kevin Lincoln spoke to frontman Hamilton Leithauser about the band''s new album <em>Lisbon</em>, getting lumped together with Interpol and whether each record is harder to make than the one that came before.\r\n\r\n<em>Listening to </em>Lisbon<em>, it seems like there’s this sense of pomp and grandeur, and a certain size that encompasses the album: after all, it’s named after an old-world city, the songs have titles like “Woe is Me,” “Victory,” “Stranded.” Do you think this is an accurate characterization?</em>\r\n\r\nYou mean in that it’s world-weary?\r\n\r\n<em> Yeah, world-weary and sort of confronting a lot in one go.</em>\r\n\r\nIt felt like a big undertaking. I’d say in the end, when you finally have eleven songs that you’re happy with, it’s almost amazing that that’s all you came up with. But it really takes a lot of work to get there.\r\n\r\n<em> So you think you can kind of feel that in the songs. Do you think that’s something that would characterize all of the albums that you guys have put out?</em>\r\n\r\nYeah, it seems to feel harder and harder as it goes along, I don’t know if that’s always true. It always takes a long time to write songs, but this time it really just felt like so much work.\r\n\r\n<em>It’s been two years since </em>You and Me<em>, about?</em>\r\n\r\nYeah, and we worked pretty steadily on this after that.\r\n\r\n<em>You guys seem to be about two years between most of your albums, right?</em>\r\n\r\nWe’re right on schedule, actually, it’s kind of weird.\r\n\r\n<em>Now that you guys are six records deep and getting towards what I think of as kind of like a Spoon-esque elder-statesmen territory in the transient world of indie-rock, how do you think that affects your work and what does that mean for the future of the band that it is getting harder with every album?</em>\r\n\r\nI don’t know, it’s kind of bleak to hear it that way, but—I don’t know, we’re sort of slow and steady, we work at our own pace. It would be nice to be able to work faster, to be able to do more, but it just takes a long time to write twelve or eleven songs or whatever it is. It’d be nice to be able to move faster, but what are you gonna do.\r\n\r\n<em>I feel like I remember reading at some point that when you guys are recording the albums, are you in the same place or are you guys spread out around the country?</em>\r\n\r\nWe’re very spread out. Walt (Martin) and I live in New York, and Matt (Barrick) and Peter (Bauer) in Philadelphia and Paul (Maroon) lives in New Orleans.\r\n\r\n<em>Paul being in New Orleans, I imagine that had something to do with the </em>Pussy Cats<em> record and </em>A Hundred Miles Off <em>and everything, that kind of influence?</em>\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah, it’s definitely one of our favorite spots whenever we show up, traveling around the country. It’s a really great city.\r\n\r\n<em>So, going back to </em>Lisbon<em>, it seemed like the pace picked up a little bit from </em>You and Me<em>, which I thought had this very nostalgic, deliberately paced sound to it, whereas Lisbon has a little more punch; you know, it’s got those same swaggering ballads but at the same time, like “Angela Surf City” and some of the other songs, they’re just a little faster. Is there any reason for that, or when you were writing the record was that just how it came out?</em>\r\n\r\nThat was how it ended up, but it wasn’t like that for the year-and-a-half that we were working on it, the first year-and-a-half was a lot more coming from the same direction. But we ended up with a couple of those songs that are on it, like “Stranded” and the last song, “Lisbon,” and a couple others were more from the earlier sessions. And then at the end, we really liked those songs but we didn’t feel like we had a complete record that had really broken any new ground until we did get a lot of those more upbeat, more sort of fun, bouncy songs. And then it felt like we had a new direction, and that was when we could all agree that we’d finished the record.\r\n\r\n<em>You guys have steadily maintained this consistent balance between the hard-charging, powerful rock and the slower wavering ballads, sometimes erring more to one side or the other: what keeps you writing songs in both registers?</em>\r\n\r\nI think we generally prefer doing the slower stuff. For us that’s kind of the most fun music, it’s more of what we listen to, but it is nice to kick doors down, we can do that, we do that pretty well. It’s hard to get to the point of being able to have everyone slamming it out and still feel like you haven’t been there before and you’re just like well, why are we doing this again. But you know, every once in a while you can get something—like, we did the Angela song this time, and it felt like we sort of earned our way back to everybody just kicking the doors down.\r\n\r\n<em>After the general acclaim and crossover success that you guys had with “The Rat” way back in the middle of the decade, was there any sort of pressure, internal or external, to try and write its successor, or try and write more of those furious, anthemic songs?</em>\r\n\r\nYeah, you’re told to write more of those. It’s very clear what people expect. At first we had the song “We’ve Been Had,” that was kind of our calling card off that record. And when you finish that, that was what everyone was asking for, all the record labels and everyone, well you just need to write another “We’ve Been Had.” But then you write “The Rat,” and everyone’s like, well you just need to write another “Rat.” They’re just responding to what you did.\r\n\r\n<em>So you guys have always been pretty strongly identified as a New York band. Have you ever felt a temptation to push back at that label? With </em>A Hundred Miles Off<em> and </em>Pussy Cats<em> and </em>Lisbon<em>, you certainly have at least worked around it, but have you ever tried to work against that?</em>\r\n\r\nI guess when we were starting out, or I guess sort of right after, we all lived here for the first eight years, six, seven years of the band, all five of us were in New York. What we figured out was we only played in New York, we’d go around and we couldn’t get shows outside of New York, the only place anybody ever knew who we were  was in like the East Village. And we would go around and play once every two weeks or something like that at these clubs. And then a lot of the bands from New York, the Strokes and Interpol and all of them, those were the bands we were sort of playing around with, they started getting really popular and I think that probably helped us out. Everyone would write an article, and instead of just writing about one band they’d write about the New York City rock world, and they’d include us as sort of like an “also” band. So I guess it definitely helped us out for a while, because it gets your name out there, but after a while it definitely started to get to be a ball and chain; we felt like we were trying to do our own thing but we feel like people weren’t really recognizing—I don’t know, when you get grouped in with bands, you kind of just want to be doing your own thing. That was the only time it ever would’ve gotten under our skin.\r\n\r\n<em>It’s funny to even think about you guys even being lumped in with those bands, because they’re great bands, but the sound isn’t really the same.</em>\r\n\r\nPeople used to write, they sound exactly like Interpol or something like that (laughs), and it’s like, no we don’t, we just don’t at all. You’d read that, one person would write it and then a lot of journalists just copy that one person. I think now people wouldn’t write that, but it’s sort of frustrating at the time because you want to be like, man, that’s just wrong.\r\n\r\n<em>I really enjoyed your year-end reading list on <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2010/12/a-year-in-reading-hamilton-leithauser-2.html">The Millions</a>, which is one of my favorite websites.</em>\r\n\r\nOh, it is? Yeah, that’s great, Max (C. Max Magee) is an old friend of mine, the guy who started it.\r\n\r\n<em>Yeah, I mean, the lists are great just in general, it’s a great feature. But this year I was particularly impressed by your choice of </em>Stoner<em> by John Williams—</em>\r\n\r\nOh I love that book, that’s a great book.\r\n\r\n<em>He’s one of those writers’ writers, the kind of guys that people with only a vested interest in literature tend to get into, so I was wondering about your reading habits and how you stay involved with that sort of stuff?</em>\r\n\r\nI can’t remember how I originally got to that book. I read a lot, I think that might’ve even been recommended on one of those automatic reading sites where you put in what you like and then it comes up. It’s kind of depressing but in the end it really sort of ends up working out.\r\n\r\n<em>Have you done any writing yourself, poems or fiction, anything outside of songwriting?</em>\r\n\r\nYou know, I would love to be able to, I think that would be so fun, and you know, we spend so much time working alone, and we have so much time where you get tired of working on music.

It’s a beautifully composed photograph, but it appears three times—unaltered—in Petra Barth’s new photography exhibition <em>Al Margen: Photographs of Latin America and the Caribbean</em>.\r\n\r\nWith 40 gelatin silver prints displayed in the Friedl Building and 30 more in Perkins Library, Barth’s exhibition is a beautiful and frequently redundant collection intended to “reveal moments that are not captured because they happen every day.... <em>Al Margen</em> is a candid photographic work that attempts to establish documentary photography as an art form as well as a method of communication.\r\n\r\nAlthough art gallery captions tend to be worded with the sweet-sounding vagueness of wine bottle labels, their purpose is quite concrete: to state the artist’s intentions. But Barth’s artist statement doesn’t draw our attention to anything original or specific—she wrote that she “would like to raise awareness about the living conditions of those who are marginalized,” also focusing on “people and the beauty of ordinary life.”\r\n\r\nBarth executes these cliches well. She emphasizes spatial thresholds by framing subjects with gates, doorways and windows. Enlarging many of her prints to expose the film’s grain, she lowers resolution to produce a kind of surreal intimacy.\r\n\r\nBarth emphasizes texture and shadow by shooting black-and-white film—quite appropriate for rubble of buildings and wrinkles on skin, the two signs of wear she seems to be preoccupied with. She pays a lot of attention to the printing process and extends the range of gray tones post-production—in one outstanding example, the texture on a boy’s face is preserved even with the sun setting directly behind him.\r\n\r\nAnother high point: a woman sitting indoors in the bottom third of the frame, developed with enough attention that the sweat on her dark skin is visible as well as the texture of a diaphanous mosquito net above. In another, a fine-browed man rests after stringing barbed wire, bracing himself between a tree and a post with canvas-gloved hands.\r\n\r\nEven considering that the content of Barth’s prints—manual labor, tumbledown shacks, sad dark faces looking away from the camera—is often akin to DukeEngage Facebook albums, she manages to keep <em>Al Margen</em> from seeming entirely exploitative of poverty with a few photos of dancers and singers.\r\n\r\nWith <em>Al Margen</em>, Barth gives us a longwinded, trite and technically sophisticated view of both successfully occupying and being trapped by two spaces.\r\n\r\nAl Margen: Photographs of Latin America and the Caribbean by Petra Barth <em>is on display through May 1 in the Fredric Jameson Gallery in the Friedl Building on East Campus and in the Special Collections Gallery in Perkins Library on West Campus.</em>', 'Art Review: Petra Barth''s ''Al Margen''', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'art-review-petra-barths-al-margen', '', '', '2011-01-22 23:24:47', '2011-01-22 23:24:47', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=561', 0, 'post', '', 1);

Actually, she is both, and in <em>Exit Cuckoo (nanny in motherland</em>), currently playing at PlayMakers Repertory Company in Chapel Hill, writer and performer Ramirez details her real-life immersion into the world of child caregiving after she moves from San Francisco to New York City to pursue her acting career.\r\n\r\nRamirez quickly discovers that she is emotionally and physically drained by her new day job, which brings her into contact with an unsettling world of immigrant women, who raise other women’s children. Her friend Eve Ensler, author of<em> The Vagina Monologues, </em>urges Ramirez to write down the stories of the nannies and mothers she meets. The result is a funny, sad and moving one-woman show that explores issues of race, class, motherhood and the politics of domestic workers.\r\n\r\nRather than reducing the nannies to victims and the mothers to villains, Ramirez succeeds in presenting a more complex account by giving insight into the guilt and disappointment that plague both the nannies who need to work and the mothers who need their nannies. Even so, it is clear that Ramirez is highly sympathetic to the plight of the nanny above all else; for the past five years, she has been volunteering and working with Domestic Workers United.\r\n\r\nRamirez makes good use of a minimalistic set—select props nestled in the confines of a stroller, a single convertible costume and a variety of accents—in order to morph between settings and characters. It is easy to forget that she is just one actress as she embodies a range of personas, including an unhappy Upper East Side trophy wife, a guilt-ridden working mom, a disapproving grandmother and nannies from several different countries.\r\n\r\nAlthough Ramirez transitions seamlessly between these parts, the accents she employs are sometimes inconsistent and several characters are portrayed as broad racial caricatures—a Latina nanny named Rosa peppers her speech with exclamations of “Ay, dios mio!” while an Irishwoman named Fiona continuously references “drinkin’ a pint.” Nevertheless, <em>Exit Cuckoo</em> cleverly interweaves its characters within this world of domestic work, and Ramirez wins the audience’s empathy as she explores her own relationship with her mother while growing passionate about the rights of domestic workers.\r\n\r\nDespite a somewhat trite ending that encourages unity and togetherness,, <em>Exit Cuckoo</em> paints a darker and more nuanced portrayal of nannying than did the 2002 novel, “The Nanny Diaries,”—and certainly makes for an impressive and enjoyable production.\r\n\r\nExit Cuckoo <em>will run at 7:30 p.m. with matinees at 2 p.m. through Jan. 16 in PlayMakers’ Kenan Theatre at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I had to look away multiple times (that''s the first time I''ve done that since No Country For Old Men).  My friend who saw it with me said that he didn''t dare touch his drink for the entire second half of the film because he was so tense.  It was an artistic masterpiece with unbelievable acting and impeccable direction.\r\n\r\n2) <em>Social Network</em> - I wanted this to be the best picture.  Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and even Justin Timberlake all give fantastic performances, layered on top of a marvelously paced and witty screenplay.  That final scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the refresh button was probably the most satisfying ending I''ve seen all year.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Toy Story 3</em> - I nearly cried watching this movie.  Seriously.  The fact that a bunch of animated toys can nearly bring an adult to tears automatically launches this to the top.  Plus, the movie is chock-full of movie references to classics like Cool Hand Luke and others, making it not only entertaining for all ages, but brilliant on an emotional and intellectual level.\r\n\r\n4) <em>Inception</em> - I am a 21-year-old male who has a poster for Batman Begins above his bed.  Christopher Nolan might be my favorite director.  I have seen almost all of Joseph Gordon Levitt''s movies.  Do I really need to explain more?\r\n\r\n5) <em>Never Let Me Go</em> - Simple and elegant.  Mulligan, Knightley, and Garfield all give powerful performances that break through the barrier between you and disbelief, and make you feel their plight as your own.  Gorgeous art direction and cinematography, complete with a moving and ultimately human story.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Comedy TV Shows (for those of us who aren''t "mature" or pretentious enough to gab about serious dramas):</strong>\r\n\r\n1) <em>Community</em> - This show is a work of genius.  Every episode finds a way to top the last.  Whether it is a dramatic episode about Troy''s birthday or a parody of <em>Apollo 13</em>, this show continues to find success in everything it does.\r\n\r\n2) <em>The League</em> - Most TV shows have at least one character that you get annoyed with.  On <em>It''s Always Sunny</em>, I usually get annoyed with Sweet Dee. On <em>The Office</em>, I usually get annoyed with Dwight (he''s great, but overused).  On <em>The League</em>, I love every character.  Every single one.  Most people have never heard of it and most people will never watch it, but it is exactly what I hope to both be and not to be like in about 15 years.\r\n\r\n3) <em>Chuck</em> - Yes, I know that nobody else watches it.  I love it.  While season four has been, shall we say, a tad disappointing, this show continues to give me butterflies in my tummy.  It is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama that more TV shows need to copy.  Viva BuyMoria.\r\n\r\n4) <em>30 Rock</em> - This is honestly one of the best comedies of all time.  The characters might be getting a little old by now, but they are still just as silly and hilarious as ever.\r\n\r\n5) <em>Psych</em> - Sure, <em>Psych</em> struggled a bit this season, sometimes coming across as stale or too self-referential.  At the same time though, Shawn and Gus continue to murder you with their dynamic.  Toss in Jules, Lassie, and occasionally their (former) secretary, Ken, and the show will kill you with laughs every time.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Best TV Episodes:</strong>\r\n\r\n1) "Chuck vs. The Other Guy," <em>Chuck</em> - This episode brings together everything great about the show, pitting romance against romance and spy against spy.  The characters, however strange and outlandish they are, came together in an incredibly human way.  On top of that, the show upped the suspense (Is Shaw good or bad? Does Sarah love Chuck??) so that it seemed that certain catastrophe was just around the bend.\r\n\r\n2) "Modern Warfare," <em>Community</em> - I could not believe this episode when I saw it.  It is such an ambitious episode, blending action parodies with a community college.  I died at every reference to <em>28 Days Later</em> or John Woo movies.  Oh, and all the clubs that popped up, like the Chess Club and the chorus kids.\r\n\r\n3) "Reaganing," <em>30 Rock</em> - What a great idea for an episode.  I practically peed my pants when Tracy kept filming the ad and, as the camera pans to him, he says, "Shirt on or off?"\r\n\r\n4) "Grilled Cheesus," <em>Glee</em> - I was worried this show had gone down the tubes and become another <em>High School Musical</em>.  Then I saw this episode.\r\n\r\n5) "High School Renunion," <em>The League</em> - Two words: The Herdsman! Heeeeyaaaaaaah!\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Best Films and TV of 2010 – Brendan Szulik', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '381-revision-37', '', '', '2011-01-11 07:02:47', '2011-01-11 07:02:47', '', 381, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=445', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

However, the films I have finally chosen are ones that I would recommend to anyone – friends, family, random strangers, you name it. They are movies that I enjoyed and that I would definitely see more than once if given the chance.</em>\r\n\r\n1. <em>Toy Story 3</em> – When Andy drove off to college and left his toys behind, I’ll admit, I got emotional. And who wouldn’t? <em>Toy Story 3</em> is so much more than a kid’s movie; it’s a comedy, it’s an action-adventure, it’s a tearjerker and it has a universal appeal that cannot be disputed. Also, Ken and Barbie were my favorite characters of any movie this year, hands down.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Shutter Island</em> – I’ll start by saying I hate psychological thrillers. And yet somehow, this movie fascinated me. It’s dark, captivating and totally unpredictable, and the ending kept me awake for days afterward. Oh, and Leonardo DiCaprio should have been nominated for a Golden Globe.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> – Finally, a Harry Potter film that didn’t make me cringe because of bad acting and mutilated plot lines! For anyone who obsessively read and/or re-read the last book (like me) this movie actually followed J.K Rowling’s work almost dead on. Though a few scenes were perhaps a little… <em>different</em> than imagined (the scene with Ron and the horcrux was unexpected, to say the least), overall, I thought it was surprisingly satisfying. Now for Part II…\r\n\r\n4.  <em>Inception</em> – Yes, two Leonardo DiCaprio films made my top 5. But who could dispute the fact that he was one of the best actors of the year? Like Shutter Island, Inception was enthralling, forcing me to question reality for days after I saw it. Admittedly, it was somewhat over-hyped – the week Inception hit theaters I read so many Facebook statuses about it that I almost didn’t want to see it – but it is definitely a must-see.\r\n\r\n5. <em>Despicable Me</em> – When it hit theaters, I had no desire to see this film – I thought it was going to be another cheesy kid’s movie that would in no way compare to <em>Toy Story 3</em>. (It’s not Pixar, after all.) But I was pleasantly surprised. Steve Carell was an excellent choice for the voice of Gru, making the character entertaining and endearing. And unlike many other films released in 2010, <em>Despicable Me</em> is one that I would actually see again.', 'Best Films of 2010 - Holly Hilliard', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '431-revision-9', '', '', '2011-01-16 02:49:20', '2011-01-16 02:49:20', '', 431, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=477', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I’m always dubious with regard to anything associated with the words  “sexy thriller,” but I shouldn’t have worried—Aronofsky is smarter than me.\r\n\r\nEverything is right—the sex, the intimations, the abjection—to the point that the predictable finale plays as a hard-won and well-deserved encore to a fairytale film.\r\n\r\nSo, no begrudging Portman for squandering her talent on <em>No Strings Attached</em>—she''s earned a breather.\r\n\r\n3. <em>The Kids Are Alright</em>: not quite<em> what</em> I thought it’d be.\r\n\r\nProps to writers for adding grit to what I expected to be a sappy, “modern” take on any other family drama.

I’m always dubious with regard to anything associated with the words  “sexy thriller,” but I shouldn’t have worried—Aronofsky is smarter than me.\r\n\r\nEverything is right—the sex, the intimations, the abjection—to the point that the predictable finale plays as a hard-won and well-deserved encore to a fairytale film.\r\n\r\nSo, no begrudging Portman for squandering her talent on <em>No Strings Attached</em>—she''s earned a breather.\r\n\r\n3. <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>: not quite<em> what</em> I thought it’d be.\r\n\r\nProps to writers for adding grit to what I expected to be a sappy, “modern” take on any other family drama. This film balances the line between being<em>different</em> (gay porn, really?) and endearingly conventional, though it’s ultimately the phenomenal casting and performances led Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, and Josh Hutcherson (!) carry the day here, and make <em>The Kids Are All Right</em> remarkably more than alright.\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Television:</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Friday Night Lights</em>\r\n\r\nI consider it a privilege to have followed this fantastic series from the beginning, as it now begins its swan song fifth season, after years of fighting scrappily to legitimize its slot on major network television.\r\n\r\n<em>FNL</em> is literary television disguised as a teen sports drama, and this unusual pairing of plot and setting might explain its failure to garner ratings befitting of its rave review. There’s nothing fancy or complicated, just honest acting without gimmicks, and sometimes shocking emotional realism.\r\n\r\nSeason 5 maintains the unlikely momentum of a show that experienced a major cast turnover in the past year.', 'Best Films and TV of 2010 – Brian Contratto', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '446-revision-10', '', '', '2011-01-17 01:55:44', '2011-01-17 01:55:44', '', 446, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=508', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

However, the films I have finally chosen are ones that I would recommend to anyone – friends, family, random strangers, you name it. They are movies that I enjoyed and that I would definitely see more than once if given the chance.</em>\r\n\r\n1. <em>Toy Story 3</em> – When Andy drove off to college and left his toys behind, I’ll admit, I got emotional. And who wouldn’t? <em>Toy Story 3</em> is so much more than a kid’s movie; it’s a comedy, it’s an action-adventure, it’s a tearjerker and it has a universal appeal that cannot be disputed. Also, Ken and Barbie were my favorite characters of any movie this year, hands down.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Shutter Island</em> – I’ll start by saying I hate psychological thrillers. And yet somehow, this movie fascinated me. It’s dark, captivating and totally unpredictable, and the ending kept me awake for days afterward. Oh, and Leonardo DiCaprio should have been nominated for a Golden Globe.\r\n\r\n3. <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> – Finally, a Harry Potter film that didn’t make me cringe because of bad acting and mutilated plot lines! For anyone who obsessively read and/or re-read the last book (like me) this movie actually followed J.K Rowling’s work almost dead on. Though a few scenes were perhaps a little… <em>different</em> than imagined (the scene with Ron and the horcrux was unexpected, to say the least), overall, I thought it was surprisingly satisfying. Now for Part II…\r\n\r\n4.  <em>Inception</em> – Yes, two Leonardo DiCaprio films made my top 5. But who could dispute the fact that he was one of the best actors of the year? Like <em>Shutter Island</em>, <em>Inception</em> was enthralling, forcing me to question reality for days after I saw it. Admittedly, it was somewhat over-hyped – the week<em> Inception</em> hit theaters I read so many Facebook statuses about it that I almost didn’t want to see it – but it is definitely a must-see.\r\n\r\n5. <em>Despicable Me</em> – When it hit theaters, I had no desire to see this film – I thought it was going to be another cheesy kid’s movie that would in no way compare to <em>Toy Story 3</em>. (It’s not Pixar, after all.) But I was pleasantly surprised. Steve Carell was an excellent choice for the voice of Gru, making the character entertaining and endearing. And unlike many other films released in 2010, <em>Despicable Me</em> is one that I would actually see again.', 'Best Films of 2010 - Holly Hilliard', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '431-revision-10', '', '', '2011-01-17 01:42:21', '2011-01-17 01:42:21', '', 431, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=510', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Ladies and gentlemen, <em>The Walking Dead</em> is a holy grail.\r\n\r\nSo yes, let''s get it out of the way immediately: I loved <em>The Walking Dead.</em>\r\n\r\nI''ve never read a single issue of the comic series by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard that this show is based on, but the collections were added to my Christmas list as soon as the pilot went to credits. It''s one of those rare projects built on the framework of a graphic novel that actually makes someone want to buy that original work to see if it''s as good as the series or film that resulted from it.\r\n\r\nI''m not a horror fan by any means. I hate jumpy, shock horror moments, and apparently <em>The Walking Dead</em> was too busy reading my mind on that to plan any schlocky jump out of the dark moments. What you get with <em>Walking Dead</em> are slow, creeping moments of terror, moving towards the characters you care about, until you''re tensed up and yelling at the scream for Rick Grimes to turn around because that damn zombie (or "walker," in the parlance of the pilot) is coming for him.\r\n\r\nThat slow, gradual terror gives the audience a lot of time with the characters too, reflecting on the real-life implications of a zombie outbreak, no longer just confined to a movie world of two hours of running and hiding in shambled houses, malls, and the like. <em>The Walking Dead</em> is about preparing, making plans, and scraping by, facing the endless swarms of the undead.\r\n\r\nAt the New York Comic Con, a packed theater full of fans was shown eight minutes of exclusive footage from the second episode of the season.  You can view the <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">trailer shown at NYCC </a><a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/The-Walking-Dead/video?bcpid=86227333001&amp;bclid=88963904001&amp;bctid=593569611001" target="_blank">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe horror''s not about the dead, it''a about living through it.\r\n\r\n<em>The Walking Dead</em> premieres October 31st at 10pm on AMC, starring Andrew Lincoln, Laurie Holden, and Jon Bernthal.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'The Walking Dead', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '218-revision-11', '', '', '2010-11-29 17:34:03', '2010-11-29 17:34:03', '', 218, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=547', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

You’re not told what is right and wrong; you connect to the characters; your views change as you grow as a person.”\r\n\r\n<em>On Sexuality in the Show</em>\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\nIn a comment that beautifully frames the discussion, Sackhoff said, “they wrote the characters first and then decided what gender they were.”  I really don’t need to say any more.  I’ll let Michelle Forbes, who played Admiral Cain, continue for me.\r\n\r\n<em> </em>\r\n\r\n“I’ve been around forever and I’ve seen a lot change; I was around when it was complete objectification.  I think we’re in an incredibly healthy place right now, and I have no complaints…. It’s so easy to focus on what hasn’t been done and not to keep up with what’s going on today. We often forget to be proud of where we are…. I don’t feel that the chasm between men and women is there any more, but there’s always work to be done,” she said.\r\n\r\n“People like Rob Moore and Alan Ball are not afraid to put women in… very interesting situations, [but] networks still need to catch up,” she noted, adding, “We have a long road ahead of us in lots of other industries.”\r\n\r\nIn another beautiful comment, Sackhoff explained one of the central tenets of sexuality on the show, and perhaps of the show as a whole, “It’s love… it’s not about what you are but who you are.”\r\n\r\nNo, I swear I’m not a fan boy….\r\n\r\nOk, I’m lying.', 'The Women of Battlestar Galactica – New York Comic Con', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '197-revision-16', '', '', '2010-10-27 02:27:56', '2010-10-27 02:27:56', '', 197, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=548', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

It''s a young Earth, with new heroes. The JSA existed back in the 40s, but the JLA has just gotten strong now and the heroes are celebrities in the public eye. Batman forms a covert-ops team out of the sidekicks of other heroes. Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, and Kid Flash go on a secret mission to Cadmus and find a certain Super boy.\r\n\r\nFor the laymen: we were shown the first act and an extended trailer of the first episode, an hour-long pilot, and while they claimed it was rough, it was easily ready for broadcast. It was so good that the audience demanded to see it again and the producers were more than happy to show it at the end of the panel, to even bigger cheers. The animation is slick and polished, the music is big and grand and the style (a mix of anime look with Western feel) is really something to see. It''s the kind of animated series people who aren''t fans of cartoons can easily get into. It''s fun, but serious, and the action is incredibly dynamic.\r\n\r\nIn typical Weisman fashion, there''s a deeper plot running through the show and a series of arcs that run in smaller pieces through the 26-episode season. Not only that, but Weisman repeatedly promised "150 characters from the DC Universe in [just the first] 18 episodes," which sounds like one hell of a feat.\r\n\r\nIf you need any other convincing, Batman will be a regular character and will be voiced by actor Bruce Greenwood, who is joining such other big names in the cast as Alan Tudyk as Green Arrow, Rob Lowe as Captain Marvel, and Jesse McCartney as Robin. Crispin Freeman, who joined the panel late (he apparently ran out of another panel to join us), voices Speedy and the Guardian.

Now, Timm and the studio that created that legendary series and its 90s-00s follow-ups is bringing forth a new animation project for a new generation of children and grown-up fans alike.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern</em> is clearly in the very early stages, to the point where all the creators had to show were the first proof-of-concept test footage they ever created and the new (and in some cases incomplete) CGI models of the characters for use in the show.\r\n\r\nWhile <em>GL</em> is going all CGI with the characters, I''m not sure if the backgrounds we saw (painted to look like "vintage sci-fi book covers") will be similarly rendered in CG. The clash of styles may be a downside, but I have no way of telling if that''s going to be a fact or merely a fear going in. The CGI models of the characters invoke the Batman: Animated look beautifully and the test footage we saw was great.\r\n\r\nThere was also some great news for fans in that the reviled <a href="http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/Bat-Embargo" target="_blank">Embargo on DC characters</a> has been lifted across the board, so everyone from the comics is fair game for all future projects, which is quite a watershed moment for tie-in material.\r\n\r\nWhat is more interesting for long-time fans is that, even with the embargo lifted, the creators of the series have chosen the Red Lanterns as the central enemy of their first season. The Red Lanterns are a more recent addition to the GL stable of villains and were chosen over classic enemy Sinestro and his recently founded Sinestro Corps because of that character''s inclusion in the upcoming <em>Green Lantern</em> film starring Ryan Reynolds. According to Geoff Johns (current writer of <em>Green Lantern</em> and DC Entertainment''s Chief Creative Officer), there will be a "mystery set up" about the whereabouts of Sinestro that will lead to potential future stories.\r\n\r\nThe series seeks to be accessible to new fans just coming in from the Ryan Reynolds-led, Martin Campbell-directed feature as well, striving for open stories in a massive sandbox, but allowing connections with a small group of strong characters like Hal Jordan, Kilowog, and Aya (a new creation for the series "strongly tied into Green Lantern mythology"). It all sounds very in-progress, but also very exciting.\r\n\r\n<em>Green Lantern: The Animated Series</em> will premiere with a Fall 2011 special and then continue in a series on Cartoon Network beginning Spring 2012.\r\n\r\n<em>Michael Nixon is a guest writer from NYU where he is a senior in the Tisch School of the Arts.</em>', 'Green Lantern: The Animated Series – New York Comic Con', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '140-revision-11', '', '', '2010-10-20 02:44:59', '2010-10-20 02:44:59', '', 140, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=550', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Hundreds of people, from filmmakers to athletes to administrators showed up to the event.  More powerful, however, were the throngs of Coach Buehler’s track athletes that had come back to Duke from all over the county.  “I’ve been looking forward to this for months and months and months,” said Jon Krassny, Trinity ‘74, adding that he “wouldn’t miss this for the word.”  Krassny and many other runners from multiple decades took this opportunity to reminisce about their experiences on the team.  “Coach has a unique way of dealing with talent,” said Larry Forrester, Trinity ‘72.  “Al’s genius was that he left us alone to find our own way to greatness.”  “He treated us like adults, ” added Peter Quance, Trinity ‘77. “The football coaches couldn’t believe we did all this on our own, that there was enough self-initiative,” said Joseph Browder, Trinity ’75.  The film’s director, Amy Unell, Trinity ‘03, said the turnout was indicative of Buehler’s impact upon people during his 55 years at Duke.<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter cocktails, the group moved to Griffith Theater for the screening of <em>The Coach Buehler Story</em>.  The film, despite its rough cut status, was met with thunderous applause and garnered much praise from the audience. “There was such an emotional connection in the audience; there was a lot of clapping, lots of tears,” Unell said.  “People came up to me balling, very emotionally moved.”  Unell also recounted stories of teachers who approached her who had been inspired to use some of Buehler’s sayings to enhance their teaching in the classroom.  “Coach is first and foremost a teacher…. And that’s what it’s all about,” she said.  Buehler himself thoroughly enjoyed the film.  “I thought it was super,” he said. “There was great photography and Grant Hill did a great job reading the script."\r\n\r\nThe film will take its message to audiences worldwide fairly soon, provided that it gains acceptance in the festival circuit. “We are tweaking it, editing it, getting it ready for film festivals,” Unell said.  And there’s already “lots of interest in distribution… on [television]” in addition to other media outlets.  With all of the successes and attention the film has already enjoyed, <em>The Coach Buehler Story</em> is sure to allow Coach Buehler to spread his legendary coaching wisdom and impact many who have never even met him.\r\n\r\n<em>You can find out more about the film at <a href="http://www.coachbuehler.com" target="_blank">www.coachbuehler.com</a>.</em>', 'Starting at the Finish Line: The Coach Buehler Story — Rough Cut Screening', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '75-revision-14', '', '', '2010-11-29 17:33:09', '2010-11-29 17:33:09', '', 75, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=552', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The beautifully photographed, simple western was a breath of fresh air in an era increasingly dominated by expensive visual effects. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld had a hilarious and heartfelt chemistry and were by far the best cinematic trio of this year.\r\n\r\n<em>The King’s Speech</em> - Though the theater I saw this film in was packed with 70 year-olds who repeated every other line to their spouses, this film will speak to audiences of all ages with nary a stutter.  Exquisitely photographed and acted to create a dreary Enlgand on the brink of war, this film is heartwarming tale of friendship and overcoming challenges of all sorts.  Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush make a hilariously unlikely pair, eliciting tears and laughs with equal efficacy.\r\n\r\n<em>The Fighter</em> - Mark Wahlberg’s character, Mickey, fights a lot more than just other boxers.  A compelling true story, <em>The Fighter</em> portrays the tenuous family and romantic relationships in Mickey’s life.  The story was captured from a very visceral, personal vantage point, fleshing out Mickey’s continuous struggle in a way not often captured in boxing films.', 'Best Films of 2010 – Andrew O’Rourke', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '455-revision-13', '', '', '2011-01-17 02:37:54', '2011-01-17 02:37:54', '', 455, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=557', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

This film balances the line between being<em>different</em> (gay porn, really?) and endearingly conventional, though it’s ultimately the phenomenal casting and performances led Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, and Josh Hutcherson (!) carry the day here, and make <em>The Kids Are All Right</em> remarkably more than alright.\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Television:</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Friday Night Lights</em>\r\n\r\nI consider it a privilege to have followed this fantastic series from the beginning, as it now begins its swan song fifth season, after years of fighting scrappily to legitimize its slot on major network television.\r\n\r\n<em>FNL</em> is literary television disguised as a teen sports drama, and this unusual pairing of plot and setting might explain its failure to garner ratings befitting of its rave review. There’s nothing fancy or complicated, just honest acting without gimmicks, and sometimes shocking emotional realism.\r\n\r\nSeason 5 maintains the unlikely momentum of a show that experienced a major cast turnover in the past year.', 'Best Films and TV of 2010 – Brian Contratto', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '446-revision-11', '', '', '2011-01-17 02:37:42', '2011-01-17 02:37:42', '', 446, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=558', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The beautifully photographed, simple western was a breath of fresh air in an era increasingly dominated by expensive visual effects. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld had a hilarious and heartfelt chemistry and were by far the best cinematic trio of this year.\r\n\r\n<em>The King’s Speech</em> - Though the theater I saw this film in was packed with 70 year-olds who repeated every other line to their spouses, this film will speak to audiences of all ages with nary a stutter.  Exquisitely photographed and acted to create a dreary Enlgand on the brink of war, this film is heartwarming tale of friendship and overcoming challenges of all sorts.  Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush make a hilariously unlikely pair, eliciting tears and laughs with equal efficacy.\r\n\r\n<em>The Fighter</em> - Mark Wahlberg’s character, Mickey, fights a lot more than just other boxers.  A compelling true story, <em>The Fighter</em> portrays the tenuous family and romantic relationships in Mickey’s life.  The story was captured from a very visceral, personal vantage point, fleshing out Mickey’s continuous struggle in a way not often captured in boxing films.', 'Best Films of 2010 – Andrew O’Rourke', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '455-revision-14', '', '', '2011-01-17 04:56:22', '2011-01-17 04:56:22', '', 455, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=559', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I would absorb everything Marcus said, but I knew that I would probably hone in on any possible allusions to Dylan’s music, with which I am moderately obsessed.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, obsession was the underlying theme of Marcus’s talk. From the beginning, he made clear that his lecture would focus on a song he’d “been obsessed with for more than forty years.” However, as Marcus later revealed, obsession (at least in his case) is never something completely one-sided. It entails an evolving engagement with the material that, if turned static and merely declaratory, loses its potency.\r\n\r\nThe song of Marcus’s long-term infatuation, “I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground,” was originally recorded by North Carolina folk musician Bascom Lamar Lunsford in the 1920s. Since then, it has been anthologized, sampled and placed in other songs, and covered in its entirety. Such artistic transference, as Marcus discussed, demonstrates the ways in which music classified as “folk” invites diverse interpretation and application. The very nature of its genre connotes accessibility, but, according to Marcus, not simplicity.\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="390" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YETlmOQWkXU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YETlmOQWkXU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n“Folk music is not simple,” Marcus said early in his lecture. “It’s weird.”\r\n\r\nHe went on to explicate this weirdness, this element of the “other,” in an impressively meticulous analysis of Lunsford’s lyricism. This analysis, however, came only after an anxious strain of technical difficulties involving the auditorium’s sound system. As the very premise of his talk necessitated sharing music with the audience, I became concerned when the lack of communication between the sound technician and Marcus continued for several minutes. The gentleman seated in front of me quietly importuned Marcus, “maybe we could sing the song?” I feared that Marcus, ostensibly a professional, would offer a derogatory rejoinder. At the same time, I envisioned the audience, led by Marcus, joining together in some collective warbling (read: my romanticized idea of a folk-fueled peaceful protest, circa 1964) of Lunsford’s piece. Neither happened, and the song eventually played—as did pieces by artists such as The Tallest Man on Earth, Bob Neuwirth, and Bob Dylan, who had each incorporated snippets of Lunsford’s song into their own.\r\n\r\nI gradually realized that my twofold reaction to the evening’s audio difficulties tended toward both the absurd and the legitimate. Perhaps a spontaneous singsong togetherness seems absurd. Perhaps even the thought of Marcus’s response to my front-row neighbor seems odd, because Marcus appeared more humored than not by the technical mishaps. Yet each response reaffirmed my consciousness of connection that evening—to Marcus, to the music, to the others alongside me who were engaged in the lecture. Above all, I felt connected to the variation in human experience that implies something both weird and beautiful. And, as Marcus suggested, this coexistence produces the type of great, long-lasting folk music exemplified by “I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground.”\r\n\r\nThe song, in its standalone complexity and temporal iterations, encourages (and even mandates) self-reflection. As Marcus said, “the song, and the way of singing the song, could call everything into question.” The ways in which we interpret the song on an individual and collective level actually call into question what it means, and what it could mean, to even <em>be</em> an individual or to<em> be</em> a collective. When we sing (or think) along with Lunsford, what do we leverage when we “wish [we were] a mole in the ground”? According to Marcus, we enter into a politics of not only music and lyrics, but also of decision-making and self-affirmation in the context of all humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd what else, besides this perpetual politics, defines our existence? It seems only right to obsess over it.', 'Marcus talks "Our Old, Weird America" at Nasher Museum', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'marcus-talks-our-old-weird-america-at-nasher-museum', '', '', '2011-03-22 22:29:48', '2011-03-22 22:29:48', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=606', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It''s boring, overblown and conceptually delusional. For most of the overlong run-time, Win Butler sounds like he needs a cup of coffee, and whenever he raises his voice, the moments that Grammy voters probably thought were so thrillingly raw, he comes across like one of the more animated characters in a daytime soap, brittle and disinterested and overly melodramatic. At best, <em>The Suburbs</em> was in an ugly tie for the third-best record nominated, with Eminem''s stilted and pop-obsessed <em>Recovery</em>. The two, actually, are each other''s rap and rock equivalents: songs for the middle-aged, short on novelty, the work of artists who view themselves as voices beyond their music. I mean, nothing against Arcade Fire, they seem like totally nice people, but with every record they get less innocent and interesting and fall deeper into kitschy faux-philosophy. Out of the five nominees, Katy Perry should''ve won, and Lady Gaga was a close second, though I think if she doesn''t get her act together Perry''s going to make her obsolete; I will give Arcade Fire the dubious honor of being better than Lady Antebellum, though. Kudos.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is more important. All of a sudden, people are acting like the Grammys have righted themselves. That they''ve raised up this tiny indie-band from the ignominy of touring the southeast corridor together in a wheezing, broken van, have propelled them into the spotlight that they so desperately deserved and were unjustly deprived of up until now. Well, Arcade Fire <a href="http://brooklynradio.net/blog/tune-in-arcade-fire-sell-out-msg">sold out MSG</a>—headlining over Spoon, who have been releasing stellar albums consistently since 1993 and are one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the last 25 years. They <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/02/arcade-fire-licenses-wake-up-to-super-bowl-for-hai.html">soundtracked the Super Bowl</a>. They <a href="http://www.buzzsugar.com/Where-Wild-Things-Number-One-Box-Office-its-Debut-Weekend-5716042">soundtracked a #1 movie</a>. U2 used that same song—"Wake Up," which is actually a really great song, off of their very solid debut <em>Funeral</em>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_%28Arcade_Fire_song%29">to open for them on one of their tours</a>. <em>The Suburbs</em> <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1645528/arcade-fires-suburbs-debuts-at-1-on-billboard.jhtml">CHARTED AT #1</a>. This has nothing to do with the quality of their music or the integrity of the group, but it''s just a fact by now: Arcade Fire are one of the most popular bands in the country.\r\n\r\nIf the press keeps lauding this as some sort of debt-paid to "authentic" or "indie" music, we''re screwed. The mainstream industry continues to morph and disintegrate, and there''s all kinds of opportunity to actually help the music-consuming public find acts pushing and producing new sounds, or doing the tried-and-true as well as possible. But this isn''t Arcade Fire, and it''ll be a shame if everyone gets hung-up patting themselves on the back for their make-believe philanthropy. Last night, the Grammys weren''t a victory for anyone other than Arcade Fire and their fans, which makes it the same as any other awards show.

I mean, nothing against Arcade Fire, they seem like totally nice people, but with every record they get less innocent and interesting and fall deeper into kitschy faux-philosophy. Out of the five nominees, Katy Perry should''ve won, and Lady Gaga was a close second, though I think if she doesn''t get her act together Perry''s going to make her obsolete; I will give Arcade Fire the dubious honor of being better than Lady Antebellum, though. Kudos.\n\nThe second problem is more important. All of a sudden, people are acting like the Grammys have righted themselves. That they''ve raised up this tiny indie-band from the ignominy of touring the southeast corridor together in a wheezing, broken van, have propelled them into the spotlight that they so desperately deserved and were unjustly deprived of up until now. Well, Arcade Fire <a href="http://brooklynradio.net/blog/tune-in-arcade-fire-sell-out-msg">sold out MSG</a>—headlining over Spoon, who have been releasing stellar albums consistently since 1993 and are one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the last 25 years. They <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/02/arcade-fire-licenses-wake-up-to-super-bowl-for-hai.html">soundtracked the Super Bowl</a>. They <a href="http://www.buzzsugar.com/Where-Wild-Things-Number-One-Box-Office-its-Debut-Weekend-5716042">soundtracked a #1 movie</a>. U2 used that same song—"Wake Up," which is actually a really great song, off of their very solid debut <em>Funeral</em>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_%28Arcade_Fire_song%29">to open for them on one of their tours</a>. <em>The Suburbs</em> <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1645528/arcade-fires-suburbs-debuts-at-1-on-billboard.jhtml">CHARTED AT #1</a>. This has nothing to do with the quality of their music or the integrity of the group, but it''s just a fact by now: Arcade Fire are one of the most popular bands in the country.\n\nIf the press keeps lauding this as some sort of debt-paid to "authentic" or "indie" music, we''re screwed. The mainstream industry continues to morph and disintegrate, and there''s all kinds of opportunity to actually help the music-consuming public find acts pushing and producing new sounds, or doing the tried-and-true as well as possible. But this isn''t Arcade Fire, and it''ll be a shame if everyone gets hung-up patting themselves on the back for their make-believe philanthropy. Last night, the Grammys weren''t a victory for anyone other than Arcade Fire and their fans, which makes it the same as any other awards show.

It was the first of thirty-three high rises in Pruitt-Igoe—a housing project in St. Louis—that was brought down after the project had disintegrated into disrepair and was declared an utter failure. \r\n\r\nBut Pruitt-Igoe wasn’t always the emblem of public housing failure. Freidrich goes back to St. Louis in the late 1940s, where a postwar economy was shifting populations, and the urban poor lived in cramped, grimy conditions. At that time, the construction of Pruitt-Igoe was a symbol of hope, lifting families from dirty alleyways to clean, furnished high-rise apartments. \r\nUsing news reports and photos from the period, Freidrich chronicles Pruitt-Igoe’s progression from sunny, safe home to imploding structure and intersperses them with interviews of academics and testimonials from former residents. The grainy images of archival footage are juxtaposed with glaringly white backdrops of individual interviews, jolting the viewer’s focus to how changing housing policies were experienced by the people actually living in Pruitt-Igoe. \r\n\r\nThe narrative is really brought to life with Benjamin Balcom’s original score.  A steady drumbeat runs strong, keeping the story plodding forward and setting the tone for each segment of the film. It creates a sense of trepidation, nostalgia, anger and sorrow as the former residents recount Christmas lights in the winter, elevators that smelled like urine, people dancing around a record player in the evenings and boys toughening up and fighting each other. \r\n\r\nThroughout the film, everyone knows the story will circle back to the image of the collapsing high rise. But when Friedrich finally shows the footage and we see the building slowly starting to cave in—the white cloud building up, the structure gaining momentum as it falls down—we understand it is not just an example of architectural failure. It is not just the symbol of a political blunder. It is someone’s home and the myriad childhood memories contained within that is crashing to the ground. \r\n', 'Full Frame Review: The Pruitt-Igoe Myth', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'full-frame-review-the-pruitt-igoe-myth', '', '', '2011-04-20 17:43:36', '2011-04-20 17:43:36', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=687', 0, 'post', '', 0);

I would absorb everything Marcus said, but I knew that I would probably hone in on any possible allusions to Dylan’s music, with which I am moderately obsessed.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, obsession was the underlying theme of Marcus’s talk. From the beginning, he made clear that his lecture would focus on a song he’d “been obsessed with for more than forty years.” However, as Marcus later revealed, obsession (at least in his case) is never something completely one-sided. It entails an evolving engagement with the material that, if turned static and merely declaratory, loses its potency.\r\n\r\nThe song of Marcus’s long-term infatuation, “I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground,” was originally recorded by North Carolina folk musician Bascom Lamar Lunsford in the 1920s. Since then, it has been anthologized, sampled and placed in other songs, and covered in its entirety. Such artistic transference, as Marcus discussed, demonstrates the ways in which music classified as “folk” invites diverse interpretation and application. The very nature of its genre connotes accessibility, but, according to Marcus, not simplicity.\r\n\r\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="390" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YETlmOQWkXU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YETlmOQWkXU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>\r\n\r\n“Folk music is not simple,” Marcus said early in his lecture. “It’s weird.”\r\n\r\nHe went on to explicate this weirdness, this element of the “other,” in an impressively meticulous analysis of Lunsford’s lyricism. This analysis, however, came only after an anxious strain of technical difficulties involving the auditorium’s sound system. As the very premise of his talk necessitated sharing music with the audience, I became concerned when the lack of communication between the sound technician and Marcus continued for several minutes. The gentleman seated in front of me quietly importuned Marcus, “maybe we could sing the song?” I feared that Marcus, ostensibly a professional, would offer a derogatory rejoinder. At the same time, I envisioned the audience, led by Marcus, joining together in some collective warbling (read: my romanticized idea of a folk-fueled peaceful protest, circa 1964) of Lunsford’s piece. Neither happened, and the song eventually played—as did pieces by artists such as The Tallest Man on Earth, Bob Neuwirth, and Bob Dylan, who had each incorporated snippets of Lunsford’s song into their own.\r\n\r\nI gradually realized that my twofold reaction to the evening’s audio difficulties tended toward both the absurd and the legitimate. Perhaps a spontaneous singsong togetherness seems absurd. Perhaps even the thought of Marcus’s response to my front-row neighbor seems odd, because Marcus appeared more humored than not by the technical mishaps. Yet each response reaffirmed my consciousness of connection that evening—to Marcus, to the music, to the others alongside me who were engaged in the lecture. Above all, I felt connected to the variation in human experience that implies something both weird and beautiful. And, as Marcus suggested, this coexistence produces the type of great, long-lasting folk music exemplified by “I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground.”\r\n\r\nThe song, in its standalone complexity and temporal iterations, encourages (and even mandates) self-reflection. As Marcus said, “the song, and the way of singing the song, could call everything into question.” The ways in which we interpret the song on an individual and collective level actually call into question what it means, and what it could mean, to even <em>be</em> an individual or to<em> be</em> a collective. When we sing (or think) along with Lunsford, what do we leverage when we “wish [we were] a mole in the ground”? According to Marcus, we enter into a politics of not only music and lyrics, but also of decision-making and self-affirmation in the context of all humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd what else, besides this perpetual politics, defines our existence? It seems only right to obsess over it.', 'Marcus talks "Our Old, Weird America" at Nasher Museum', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '606-revision-13', '', '', '2011-02-20 22:43:06', '2011-02-20 22:43:06', '', 606, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=685', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

There are two problems with this.\r\n\r\nThe first one isn''t usually what the Grammys would call a problem—more like the status quo. To put it simply, <em>The Suburbs</em> is a mediocre record. It''s boring, overblown and conceptually delusional. For most of the overlong run-time, Win Butler sounds like he needs a cup of coffee, and whenever he raises his voice, the moments that Grammy voters probably thought were so thrillingly raw, he comes across like one of the more animated characters in a daytime soap, brittle and disinterested and overly melodramatic. At best, <em>The Suburbs</em> was in an ugly tie for the third-best record nominated, with Eminem''s stilted and pop-obsessed <em>Recovery</em>. The two, actually, are each other''s rap and rock equivalents: songs for the middle-aged, short on novelty, the work of artists who view themselves as voices beyond their music. I mean, nothing against Arcade Fire, they seem like totally nice people, but with every record they get less innocent and interesting and fall deeper into kitschy faux-philosophy. Out of the five nominees, Katy Perry should''ve won, and Lady Gaga was a close second, though I think if she doesn''t get her act together Perry''s going to make her obsolete; I will give Arcade Fire the dubious honor of being better than Lady Antebellum, though. Kudos.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is more important. All of a sudden, people are acting like the Grammys have righted themselves. That they''ve raised up this tiny indie-band from the ignominy of touring the southeast corridor together in a wheezing, broken van, have propelled them into the spotlight that they so desperately deserved and were unjustly deprived of up until now. Well, Arcade Fire <a href="http://brooklynradio.net/blog/tune-in-arcade-fire-sell-out-msg">sold out MSG</a>—headlining over Spoon, who have been releasing stellar albums consistently since 1993 and are one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the last 25 years. They <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/02/arcade-fire-licenses-wake-up-to-super-bowl-for-hai.html">soundtracked the Super Bowl</a>. They <a href="http://www.buzzsugar.com/Where-Wild-Things-Number-One-Box-Office-its-Debut-Weekend-5716042">soundtracked a #1 movie</a>. U2 used that same song—"Wake Up," which is actually a really great song, off of their very solid debut <em>Funeral</em>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_%28Arcade_Fire_song%29">to open for them on one of their tours</a>. <em>The Suburbs</em> <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1645528/arcade-fires-suburbs-debuts-at-1-on-billboard.jhtml">CHARTED AT #1</a>. This has nothing to do with the quality of their music or the integrity of the group, but it''s just a fact by now: Arcade Fire are one of the most popular bands in the country.\r\n\r\nIf the press keeps lauding this as some sort of debt-paid to "authentic" or "indie" music, we''re screwed. The mainstream industry continues to morph and disintegrate, and there''s all kinds of opportunity to actually help the music-consuming public find acts pushing and producing new sounds, or doing the tried-and-true as well as possible. But this isn''t Arcade Fire, and it''ll be a shame if everyone gets hung-up patting themselves on the back for their make-believe philanthropy. Last night, the Grammys weren''t a victory for anyone other than Arcade Fire and their fans, which makes it the same as any other awards show.

It was the first of thirty-three high rises in Pruitt-Igoe—a housing project in St. Louis—that was brought down after the project had disintegrated into disrepair and was declared an utter failure. \nBut Pruitt-Igoe wasn’t always the emblem of public housing failure. Freidrich goes back to St. Louis in the late 1940s, where a postwar economy was shifting populations, and the urban poor lived in cramped, grimy conditions. At that time, the construction of Pruitt-Igoe was a symbol of hope, lifting families from dirty alleyways to clean, furnished high-rise apartments. \nUsing news reports and photos from the period, Freidrich chronicles Pruitt-Igoe’s progression from sunny, safe home to imploding structure and intersperses them with interviews of academics and testimonials from former residents. The grainy images of archival footage are juxtaposed with glaringly white backdrops of individual interviews, jolting the viewer’s focus to how changing housing policies were experienced by the people actually living in Pruitt-Igoe. \nThe narrative is really brought to life with Benjamin Balcom’s original score.

Though unwieldy and difficult to apprehend, the story is familiar and bursts at the seams with archetypal characters and themes.<em> </em>\r\n\r\nThe film catapults us through the galaxies in the staggeringly gorgeous cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, before zooming into the saga of a 1950s American family whose narrative evokes <em>Our Town </em>and <em>East of Eden</em>. <em>The Tree of Life </em>is more audacious than either.\r\n\r\nThe story emphasizes the recurring nature of a "loss of innocence," avoiding the myth of a single coming of age event that affects children alone. Mr. O’Brien (Brad Pitt), a personification of 1950s male values, must also experience the uprooting of his moral fiber when he is denied the success his formidable work ethic should have insured. And his gorgeous, gentle young wife must struggle through the troubling contradictions imbedded in the conventional wisdom of parenthood, and later, the premature death of her son.\r\n\r\nThe limp condolences Mrs. O’Brien (Jessica Chastain) receives—“people pass along, nothing stays the same”—are suddenly revitalized and exaggerated when the film cuts back several million years to an extended scene of a massive erupting volcano, reminiscent of the <em>Planet Earth</em> series.\r\n\r\nBut the domestic scenes are equally stunning: the confusion and wonder Jack (played excellently by Hunter McCracken) experiences interacting with his newborn brother; the gut-wrenching guilt written on his face after he steals from the neighbor girl’s underwear drawer; the pathos of the moment when he says, "You''re my brother!"\r\n\r\nFortunately, <em>The Tree of Life</em>’s treatment of “family values”—as an admirable pursuit with some sinister pitfalls—stems from Malick’s own empathetic impulse instead of contrived moral ambiguity. Even while highlighting man’s infinitesimal condition, he dignifies the comfort found in religion, tradition and platitudes—even the excessive faith we place in the grave importance of our lives.\r\n\r\nWhen an adolescent Jack fantasizes about killing his domineering father, a highly dramatic score is used to evoke the same desperation he feels. Malick frequently capitalizes on these advantages his medium has over writing and theater. Instead of dialogue, <em>Tree of Life</em> communicates most explicitly through its silent vignettes and the actors’ intimations.\r\n\r\nThe film is shockingly earnest, the product of an overzealous mind exercising his craft with zero inhibitions  (one can imagine the decision to include CGI dinosaurs was not unanimous). As a means of entertainment, it approximates the divisiveness of staring at the sun, and produces a similar effect: audiences leave the theater shell shocked—some furious, others smug about not succumbing to the pretentiousness and others stammering inelegant expressions of praise.\r\n\r\nAll responses are valid. <em>The Tree of Life</em> tackles way too much content, overwhelms to the point of discomfort and still emerges victorious and lucid. In a film that both amplifies the human condition and obliterates it with literal perspective, the effect is perfect.', 'Film Review: Tree of Life', '', 'pending', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2011-06-28 15:52:28', '2011-06-28 15:52:28', '', 0, 'http://recess.nujigroup.com/?p=720', 0, 'post', '', 0);
