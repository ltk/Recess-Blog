Gigs Calendar Templates

WARNING!

Do not edit any files in this folder.  If you do, you do so at your own risk.  
WordPress will delete any changes you make when you perform the automatic 
upgrade for this plugin.

Instead create a gigs-templates folder in your wp-content directory and copy
the basic template there before you make any changes.
